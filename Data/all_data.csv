And I guess lastly from me, I just want to touch on working capital continues to be impressive with payables, as you know, ellipsing over 102% of inventory now. How much more room do you think you have in that as we model out for one?

When you guys are analyzing shoppers that are using either CostcoGrocery, Instacart, I'm curious if the purchases have replaced the in-store trip. And I guess if you've analyzed how that could potentially impact your in-store traffic over the next two to five years?

6,3019,39016,39016,"Well, with the seasonal issues, our Q1 is a month or right around Thanksgiving time. And that's generally when it's the highest payables as a percent of inventories. So, I think generally, the low point is Q2 with February where the sales are a little softer on a seasonal basis.Other than that, if anything, as we build out e-com and have more inventory in there and want to make sure we're trying to grow it, that actually probably impacted a little negatively that was turning to the fact that it's currently a very strong number.We also have some programs where ideally, sometimes, you have been -- there's usually smaller vendors that even though we have negotiated extended terms in some cases, particularly in seasonal items or stuff that's coming a few months and, sometimes, if they need working capital, it's a good rate of return for us to pay early, if you will, what's called anticipation. These are not big numbers, but those impacted a little bit that will reduce itself. Overall, I'd probably look at what those percentages were at each of the quarter end for the last few years and assume it's not that different.

7,3019,47358,47358,"Hey Richard. Thanks for taking my questions. One question I'm getting is just a lot on the chicken plant. Can you just sort of let us know how that is going so far versus expectations? And also was it about $10 million of the preopening expense this quarter? And how does it affect preopening going forward? And maybe related to chicken plants, are there any other types of vertical integration, things that you might be looking out to do further?",QID_30,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
8,3019,52468,52468,"30 years ago, I think the view was you needed about 0.5 million people to trade area plus certain number of businesses and all that kind of stuff. Today, that number could be as low as 200,000 sometimes. It depends.Some of the smaller or medium markets we've gone into in the last few years generally are markets where our competition -- our direct competitors were, in many cases, for 20 or 30 years and we had just never gone there. We've gotten probably a little more confident that when we go in it, there's room for both of us, and we've done relatively well.I think the other thing is, if you look back over the last few years and my guess is in the upcoming years, there'll be some infill opportunities. I've used the example on calls on the East side of Seattle, in the Bellevue side of Seattle where, historically, we had three locations, Issaquah, Kirkland and Woodinville. About two years ago, we opened in Redmond. And we only added -- let's say in those three locations, had about 190,000-ish members between them, households, so 60,000, 65,000 each. We only added about 10,000 new members in the next year, but you had a lot of loyal members that started shopping more frequently because we were closer to them.Part of that comes with you have high volume. And those -- that example, I think as -- before we opened that fourth location on this side of Seattle, we had I think over $800 million aggregate sales, 1 in the low threes and the other two in the mid to high twos. And when you get to that level, that gives a little more comfort that you can afford a little cannibalization. In that example, I think the first year, net of cannibalization, we did $120-plus million of business, $120 million, $130 million of business. So, it's pretty easy to estimate and guesstimate what you think you can do particularly when you have a loyal membership base.And then there are other markets like if you look at the Greater Los Angeles market, I'm talking greater geographic market, I think we probably have 60-ish -- roughly 60 units. The view is we can have another 15, but they're all very specific geographies, which are not quite impossible, but very difficult. And we'd be thrilled to get 1 of those 15 open every couple of years, but you don't know if that can happen. So, I think it's all over the board in terms of smaller trade areas, markets where our competition has been and we are just entering and then continue the expansion and infills.",AID_34,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
9,3019,58802,58802,"Okay. And then looking at the tariff situation, could that maybe an impetus to put -- use private label sourcing on more products as a result to get the price down?

10,3019,36178,36178,"A little more half. Okay, that's good enough. Richard, when you guys bring popular branded products where there's a lot of price transparency, you mentioned Weber grills on the call in your website, how are you guys trying to target for pricing on those kinds of products when they can be found in lots of different spots? Can you guys price competitive, of course, but can you provide any color on kind of how you're thinking about kind of price caps when you've got obviously the Home Improvement guys out there, Amazon, Amazon Marketplace, et cetera?",QID_21,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_attack
11,3019,59103,59103,"Yes, not really for tariffs. First of all, some of our private label items are sourced out of China as well, so it's going to impact everybody. And nothing changes quickly overnight. In terms of KS items, I think that you have seen of late and you'll continue to see a variety of items, I mean recent introductions or things like all kinds of specialty waters, essence waters, extra virgin olive oil that they have some impact on tariffs, chocolate chips.I'm just looking down the list here, several apparel items for men, women and children, more housewares. So, I think you're going to continue to see that grow and even -- and raise the quality further of existing items, that continuous improvement cycle. You're going to see that on some frozen food items, diapers. I'm just looking down my list here, soaps, coffee pods.We've taken the KS coffee pod, which I think, three or four years ago, we went -- it went to fair trade. Since then, we -- it's now organic and recyclable and we've lowered the price by over 10% to the customer while improving, if you will, the value and the quality. And it's driving more sales.

15,3019,36749,36749,"Yes. Look, we want to be the lowest priced and we're going to go as low as we can feel good about it.

And that's to show on even greater settings. And we've done that in all kinds of things, whether it's computers or big appliances.And by the way, I think a lot of times; competitive pricing tends to be on some of the entry level and what you see advertised, if you will.

And then that is still to a slight net positive than what we've seen before. But we have to be on the lookout is does it replace the shop? How many shops does it replace? But what we're seeing is you've got more -- somebody who's inflowing if you will and reducing their trips to the location a little bit. So, I call it neutral to slightly good right now, but that doesn't -- who knows what happens tomorrow? So far, I mean, we feel good about that, by the way. But we can't predict.I think by the way, I think part of it also is when we talked about -- what we talked about in the past is we use -- to communicate to our members aside from the traditional Costco connection and a lot of the e-mails, and the e-mails are not just for shopping online, e-mails are talking about hot things that are happening in the warehouse while supplies last in some cases. And we've seen good examples of that that can help drive frequency to the warehouse or create a trip.And that along with gasoline, not every person fills up with gas comes in. So, I think about half do, a little over half do. Even if one of them is incremental, that's a positive. We don't check to see what that is. We're not asking you to.

It's going to be very efficient, but it's going to take close to a year to get to full production. And the first several weeks have gone as planned in terms of the first chicken went through and more each day and -- but you're going to get to 2 million -- processing of 2 million birds a year -- I'm sorry, 2 million birds a week in about 40 more weeks.The preopening stopped effectively when we opened it on September 10th. So, there's a little bit in Q1 but not like that big amount. But it's a huge facility, and it's also air-chilled. About 95% of U.S. poultry plants are still water chilled. So, all the issues in terms of -- it's considered a very high-quality food item and it allows us to deliver that while doing a lot of things for the environment as well. So, there's a lot of good things. It didn't come without a cost. It was a big investment for us and a little bit more in a year, but we're excited about it.Other things, we had -- a year ago, we had a second meat plant. We've had one in Tracy, California for many years. We opened one in Morris, Illinois. We also, as you know, opened a bakery commissary in Canada that will also serve much of the United States in terms of things like cookie dough and croissants ready to bake off on premise.We're looking at a variety of greenhouse opportunities. There's a lot of technology and new things going on in the area of agriculture. Would be nice to greatly lower the price of not having to airship things to Hawaii as well as being closer to the market and being better for the environment. So, I think given our size and given some of the things that are going on, we're going to hopefully benefit from that. But that's -- other than that, there's nothing else, I don't think, we've got planned in a big way.

That being said, we're pretty methodical when we go into a new country, wherever it is, and we opened one or two units to start with over the first year or two and go from there. A lot of it has to do with the fact that building the people structure within a country, while we have help from neighboring countries and other areas to start the process, you really want to build your supervisor, your functional managers in the country.So, if you'd asked us before, we even opened the first one and felt positive it will be good, but who knows how and when we do -- how well we will do.

You guys have done this for a long time, we were a little later to the game then others in terms of collecting e-mail addresses years ago. And we had a big push in the last couple of years and we dramatically increased the number of members where we have good e-mail addresses. Now that sounds simple and why did we do that, I can only tell you we are and it's -- and that's helping. We're getting more people, we're getting more people to open the e-mail and click on things.And so I think we need to talk about in the past. We still have these different buckets of money starting with the improved -- the improvement from the credit card transition a couple of years ago to membership fee increase, tax reform, all these things have helped and, as you know, we take that into make it a better value for the member. And I think that's helped us whether it's buyers, Hot Buys, a while items. And I think that's giving us a little bit of a leg up over the last couple of years in terms of helping achieve the numbers that we have.So, I think more connections the members are going to help. Certainly, there's no slowdown in renewal rates. That's been good to us. Beyond that, it's what we see every four weeks in our budget meetings from the Myers, doing exciting stuff, constantly improving existing items. There are a number of examples, whether at KS side is we continue to improve the item and lower the price point well and improved item, and therefore, decrease the value dramatically. They're looking at exciting items, not just for us in the U.S. to ship to these other countries, but also to take some exciting items from other countries and bringing them to other parts of Costco.So, I think on when I think about from a merchandising standpoint, we're at the top of our game a lot of things. On the efficiencies side, we have a lot of expenses going on. We talked about e-commerce for a moment. There's cost associated with that as we do that. There's IT in general, with everything that we've got going on, whether it's e-commerce or fulfillment and depot infrastructure, the new poultry complex. So, there's lots of things that are in our numbers in terms of expenses as well and we've done pretty well. So, a little -- I think we keep doing the kinds of things that we're doing as it relates to global sourcing and in some cases, some vertical integration and -- but ultimately, driving more value.",AID_27,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

63,3019,29256,29256,"Sure. I mean generally speaking, the bigger the ticket items where you also have a good portion of the tariffs impacts the price, raises the price. I mean there was -- these are anecdotal examples, but there was one category of those types of items that typically is up mid-single-digits year-over-year and instead was flat to down a couple of percent. And that is -- that included some pricing increases, so probably; I was down 10% in units. But that's a subset of a subset of a category, and so I don't want to suggest it was everything.But I mean given examples from our buyers where there have been items where we've essentially -- most of the tariffs is reflected in our price increase and we saw just as many users as we thought we were going to previous to that. There's been others where we've -- the price increase tariff-related, less than half of the tariff related to the price increase and even that, we saw some unit reductions results. So, it really has been over the board.But generally speaking, the bigger the item, when you pick an item that retails for $999 and have to get it up, we get it even about $1,240 -- by using a 25% example or beat 25% of the cost. But unless -- first that you try to do is get it to $1,199 and then go from there or $1,099. But it's really over the board.

I mean it's hard. With smaller-ticket items, it might be easier to eat a little bit of it. One with something like furniture or Lawn & Garden and things like that, that's a little harder. But overall, we have -- we generally feel pretty good about it.And we're, by the way, the other thing is we're an item-driven business. I'm sure -- I don't have examples in front of me, but I'm sure there have been examples of items where if we weren't able to greatly mitigate or mitigate as best we can be some of that tariff, in some cases again, we will try to geographically move the item or source from another supplier.

If you think about a customer, where we're bringing in, say OEM fasteners or we’re bringing in, it’s vending customers, we're bringing in. We do a lot of hand protection through our vending devices. So we are bringing in that kind of product, your visibility to need and supply chain are much more dialed in. So that element of the product turns faster because you're bringing in products that that you might, you might have a three month supply, four month supply, five months supply. So it turns a little faster. And the variability in that is dependent on not how quick it hits the cost impact but how long, how many months of, how many days of inventory have can change. If all of a sudden that customers business OEM fasteners are down 20%, what you thought was a five month supply just and six months supply, that means you have the legacy of that problem a little longer.But it still hits relatively quickly. Same thing in a lot of our vending on our hand protection. Now if you went and visited a bunch of our branches and you looked at a lot of the MRO fasteners and a lot of the products that are in our branches, that's product where we have less certainty, less visibility to demand and we stock it a bit deeper because of that. There you have products that might turn once a year.And so there are some elements of both, a lot of our discussions with our customers is on the former not the latter, because that's the product that's the product in their nose spin as opposed to their tailspin, it’s a tailspin that becomes a little more difficult from a turn standpoint.

There’s a handful where the model changed, right where we opened the Onsite because the purchasing manager liked the model and that purchasing manager has now moved on and new ones in place doesn't like the model as much.And so, they’ve changed it.

But remember tariffs are a little bit different and that it's not about when you purchase the products about when it hits the shores. And so if our six months, sort of supply chain lag is three months overseas on the water and three months domestically, then the impact from tariffs, you're going to feel that once it hits the shore, but from that period to the time that it flows through the network, that's really more like three months.So the List 3 tariffs, those costs were largely in 3Q, I don't anticipate an incremental impact in 4Q from the List 3 tariffs.

I know based on history that when we come into a new year, I can assume that 5% of our national account revenue from last year will be gone not because we lost the customer, but because across those thousands of locations, there were special projects going on in 2019 that won't happen in 2020. And so if we want to grow our national account business and I'll just pick an arbitrary number, if we want to grow our national account business 15%, we have to go into the year with a plan to hit 20 because we know we're starting to downsize. When I think of our vending business, this year we will pull out about 13% of our vending machines based on our installed base.And that's been true for years actually, if I go back five years ago, we were pulling out about 25% of our installed base every year from the prior year. Because we put in 10, we realized we needed eight; we put in two, we realized that wasn't a great place to put vending; and we improved the business over the last decade, we've pulled out north of 40,000 vending machines from locations where we've installed them. And what do we have to show for it, we have a business that went from zero to we will do about 1.1 billion through vending this year.It helps our overall organization grow faster. It's a nice discrete business in and of itself. And but I know that every time we placed 10 machines are so likely we're going to pull a few of them back. And I love the business. And I love the fact that we're always rationalizing. I don't know ultimately like on the Onsite, what is the churn rate? But I don't know, maybe 5% a year is a number. I hope I don't see that number in the report that comes out now that Dan Florness do this. But I'm just saying it's, it's a business and you approach it from pragmatic business perspective.

If I look at heavy manufacturing, now heavy equipment is a subset of that, if I look at heavy manufacturing as a business, that's about it’s between 35% and 40% of our revenue, so it's a big swath of our revenue.That was growing about 13.5% in the first quarter, that dropped a little over 8% in the second quarter and it was about 6% in the third quarter. So mirrors up pretty well with what our reported number is. If I look at heavy equipment subset in there, which is about two-thirds of that component, it's about 27% of our revenue, 13.5% in the first quarter. So in line with the overall heavy manufacturing, 7.5% in the second quarter, so we're starting to pull down that overall heavy manufacturing group. It dropped a 4.5% in the third quarter.So two things jump out of that, that's lot of OEM fasteners in there, lot of production in there that weakened as we went through the year. The interesting thing is that there was a divergence between the two-thirds of the heavy manufacturing, that's heavy equipment and the one-third that is and there's a divergence and there's more resiliency in the other group. So the overall number isn't declining as much and I go into the weed and get a little wonky and only from the standpoint of that's that demonstrates what our team is doing, our national accounts team, our regional teams are doing, that's market share gains. We're picking up great market share because our customers are struggling right now.

And I think if volumes are flattish, I think that next year, we will get whatever we get based on market share gains and call that between 5% to 7%. There's probably a little bit of incremental price that flows in there just because we recognized for a full-year what we've put in as this year progresses.

It is really driven by the fact that the customers have figured out that in the devices that they want to make, whether 7-nanometer or whether it’s DRAM 1Z products that the performance of EUV layers and the productivity that they can now count on, gives them the confidence that this is the way to go.So, this is the -- the first question that they will internally answer and then will share it with us.

We think there's a bunch of opportunities both in the United States with existing partners and expanding the number of bundles and sort of the bundle availability. We'll also seek to expand that globally because we think there's a tremendous number of opportunities globally to add those kind of partners and make it easier for members to sign up.We did a couple this quarter, whether it's Canal+ and Sky Italia with sort of new partners for our bundles, but we've also done things like take KDDI, a mobile operator in Japan, and be able just to expand our presence across their offering, which makes again an easier place more attractive for more members to sign up.So it's still small, a relatively small fraction of our acquisition, but it's a nice, good, incremental way to access a member base, member to be based.

Combine that with some of that elevated churn that we saw in Q3 and the potential for that to continue into Q4.And then lastly, there is obviously a few new competitors launching in the near term, and we try to factor that in as well. Inevitably, there is probably going to be some curiosity and some trial of those competitive service offerings. So when we put all that together, again, we adjusted our forecast slightly.

So you're trying to finely -- fine-tune the proposition to the customer, great storytelling, how and when they want to watch it.And what we have seen in comparison -- because we have about 35 shows around the world that we release week-over-week because it's premiering in that territory of Netflix, and we don't want to -- and we want to deliver on it as soon as it -- as close to the broadcast window as we can.So what we - and what we've seen is, in markets where we released it all at once versus 1 a week that we actually get more viewing and cumulatively more social media buzz, more tweets, more activity on social media around these shows for the all-at-once model. So people are coming to it at different times. They're loving it more. It's in a more concentrated experience, for sure.All of that being said, we are doing things like producing -- like you saw with The Ranch where we are producing 10-episode seasons with smaller gaps between seasons, so coming out 6 months apart rather than a year apart.You're seeing we're testing an interesting release pattern with Rhythm + Flow, a music competition show, that - and basically, what we're trying to do is match not just the program exactly that you want to watch but how do you want to watch it.

And our -- we're pretty uniquely positioned with a $15 billion content budget to be able to deliver on those scope and scale at the same time for film and television.So that incredible - that slate that I just rattled off to you, it's happening at the same time that we have returning seasons of End of the expletiveing [ph] World, The Crown, Lost in Space, You, all incredibly popular shows. Casa de las Flores from Mexico, Baby from Italy, all back for returning seasons.Breaking brand-new series like The Witcher, Daybreak, all at the same time being able to deliver on what we think is an incredible value proposition for the viewers.

So, I know that – I believe chole is a faster procedure relative to some of the more complex areas where the robot gets used.

293,3024,23553,23553,"I'll just draw a broader picture and I'll let Calvin speak to a little bit of the modeling. In the broader sense, we know that in a mature market that has experience with robotic surgery that procedure demand will drive the underlying system demand, and there's two ways that they go about it. One is capacity and they can get additional capacity by more efficient utilization of their systems. We have designed our systems with that in mind. We work closely with them and in various arrangements to help them get improved efficiency. They don't have to buy an X system if they don't want to.The other thing is feature content. Does the product have the feature content that's required to do the procedures they want to do? And so, we work with them on those things.Clearly, competitors will enter the market and make claims. And I guess what I would say for both customers and for shareholders, due diligence is really important. It's really easy to make claims on trade show floors and it's pretty hard to back them up in real life. And our experience in the world has been that there is a lot of noise in the beginning as those claims are made and then it takes a couple or three years in the actual clinical market and clinical use to see what the broad market thinks about that.That will have an impact for us in the next few years. I don't know if it's next year or the year after, and I think that's what Marshall's commentary was. Signaling is that customers will evaluate and will take their time and that may change capital acquisition cycle timelines or otherwise and they change the nature of negotiations for us. But we're planning and thinking for the long term and we're focused on enablement of the quadruple aim and we'll be here for our customers as we go through that.Calvin, anything you want to help with our modeling?\nCalvin Darling: No, clearly, procedures are the catalyst for driving the demand for systems.

So, it's been on a nice, fairly decent upward slope. What would you say, I guess, over the longer term with respect to that trend line, given you have so much data, but it is a dynamic business?

If you could comment on that number or just give any general commentary as it relates to robotic surgery penetration. I know you talk qualitatively about it being early innings, but just specifically that quantitative figure, I'd like your thoughts.

319,3024,130,130,"Good afternoon. Just a couple of questions for me. Gary, just starting off on procedure acceleration. Even adjusting for selling, there's still a couple hundred basis points, maybe 200 basis points to 300 basis points of momentum acceleration into the third quarter. I wonder if you could talk about some of the drivers there. You talked about the gen surg capacity issues last quarter. Sounds that they've been resolved. But was that the principal driver of the momentum improvement or could just kind of point out other factors that drove this relative momentum acceleration into the third quarter? And then, I'd have a quick follow-up.",QID_1,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_support
320,3024,5131,5131,"Yeah. I think as you look at Q4 and then further out into 2020, the growth drivers, as you say, Larry, are general surgery in the United States as well as growth outside the United States, and I think that's likely to continue to be the drivers. At the high end of the guidance range, I think we're seeing consistency with where we are on a year-to-date basis. But, again, in the third quarter, we saw benefit for some of the mature categories. I think at the lower end, you can contemplate some moderation there.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
321,3024,7886,7886,"Yeah. On the chole side, Tycho, talked about the acceleration being driven by a healthy mix of the new surgeons and existing surgeons, not a lot of churn and increasing Firefly utilization. So, that feels a lot different than, say, our earlier experience with single site set of tools or it was more of a cosmesis-oriented value proposition.And what's interesting is, while in the past, chole may have been a popular training procedure, and it still can be that, now it's not necessarily the first procedure. It's a lot more often that it's, say, a hernia repair that's the first procedure. And as general surgeons are applying robotics across their practices, chole obviously a big part of what they do.So, there are reasons for optimism given what we see in the data, but we continue to monitor and analyze the growth trends closely and remain conservative about the overall opportunity.\nGary Guthart: On prostatectomy\nCalvin Darling: Yeah, prostatectomy, I think we've pretty much stated on that.

I think the opportunity for computer-aided and robotically assisted surgery and acute intervention more broadly is clearly substantial and clearly durable. And that's going to draw in new entrants, which it's doing. I think those new entrants will help accelerate broader adoption more generally and customers will appreciate that choice. And I think they will look at that.Our strategy over this period has really been, understand our customers deeply and understand the quadruple aim. It's really hard to do the total accounting of what the total available market will be.And what I'd ask you to look at is over time. What does it look like in the next couple of years? What does it look like in the next four? What does it look like in the next 10? I think some of our competitors as they speak about these opportunities are looking out pretty far. And, okay, that's a forecast. Hard to have an exact crystal ball. But, clearly, even speaking with our most candid critics, the idea that computer aids and robotics are going to make an impact more broadly in surgery is pretty well accepted. So, I think we're early innings.Japan, I think likewise. A little bit different healthcare system. The single payer system that runs through MHLW or the predominantly single-payer system means that their requirements and negotiations using data with the government early are much more important and getting those right opened the market over time, and that's what we've been working on. So, clearly, that's an early set of opportunities for us as well.Our methodology, when we think about total available market, is to be conservative in the early days, show that we can bring real value and then revise as we see greater depth.

Marshall mentioned in his comments that we did see a benefit relative to the last quarter just due to timing of orders, but, obviously, higher usage of the advanced stapling and vessel sealings also contributed to the growth.Going forward, clearly, the favorable timing of the orders should offset, but there is a number of factors that are going to kind of impact the trend going in different directions, including the anticipated continued growth in the advanced instrument usage, offset by an increasing proportion of lower complexity cases like cholecystectomy that we've talked about.

I think our team does a great job of also capturing into the all-mix business with the TRP brands, where 50% of those customers are new to PACCAR, which creates a great opportunity for growth for us as well. And I think we're always looking at opportunities to grow, not just the parts business itself, but provide increased levels of service for our customers, and that comes through higher degrees of connectivity of the trucks, where we understand better what's going on.

And then I would also say that we also looked at the patients who had not completed 18 months, all the rest of the patients, which is roughly half the patients because we only looked at the first half, the first half of the enrollees for futility. So it’s a large number of patients that we ended up looking at and I remind you that result that you saw in that slide was all the patients in EMERGE, who had been randomized, the ITT population and it was using the prespecified primary and secondary endpoints.

In terms of the EMERGE and ENGAGE, I – we looked at – we look at ENGAGE in totality as a positive study that stands on its own. And remember, as Samantha said we use pre-specified primary and secondary outcomes, we didn’t look at a subset. We looked at all the patients and based on that, we believe the study met its primary endpoint and the secondary endpoints as well. I think that whether or not a single trial can be approved, there are circumstances where an FDA can approve a drug based on a single study, it’s up to them to determine what those circumstances are, and so I’ll just leave it at that and then I would say that ENGAGE, we believe, we showed the data for example in those who achieve sufficient exposure to 10 milligrams per kilogram. We do see evidence of efficacy. So I would say that EMERGE stands on its own, ENGAGE has supportive evidence, and I would also say that PRIME is supportive, it’s a well controlled Phase 1b, some may call it Phase 2 trial, and we’ll submit all the data.Samantha Budd Haeberlein: Just to add there, Al, EMERGE is the study that met its primary endpoints.

And then, can you maybe help us understand how feasible was it for patients?

It seems like the trials didn’t start far apart, there’s just a month, so kind of in response to the last question, you mentioned exposures rely on dose suspensions and whatnot.

As we mentioned, one of the first steps that we undertook was to engage external advisors to help us review this data and that did include independent statistical experts, but the data that we did take to the FDA as Al says was a full dataset, which was an analysis of the blinded data conducted using the same statistical analysis plan as we had originally planned for the end of the study. And the validity of the dataset was the first thing that we analyzed together with the FDA. To your second question on whether we are conducting another study.

I remember, Michael, and we thought that was an outlier. Well, maybe that wasn’t the outlier. Maybe that was true in that the 3 milligram per kilogram that looked like it was trending was the outlier.

I want to point out that the analysis that we conducted in close consultation with the FDA around determining who in ENGAGE did have a response were exploratory analysis. And any time that you look at a subset of patients who you have very important questions in regards to whether they are balance for the baseline characteristics. The studies overall, were very well balanced for all baseline characteristics and as I mentioned, ApoE4 status. But those subgroups are exploratory in nature and they help us understand that dosing is important for efficacy. And in the context of an 18-month trial, one does tend to see that you need a certain number of doses for clinical benefit of aducanumab. However, that’s not the same as one would anticipate in a real world situation where an individual is taking aducanumab for an extended period of time, for a dose interruption would likely be of less significance.Al Sandrock: Yes, I agree with Samantha. I think that dose suspension in the context of an 18-month study was – it could be problematic, because they didn’t achieve enough of the high dose. But in clinical practice, we don’t do 18 month treatment periods. We’re going to treat patients for longer periods of time.

Second, the implication in the data is that the high with insufficient exposure at the high dose, the second trial worked as well. But when we look at CDR Sum of the Boxes low dose actually looks more consistent than the high dose and also for patients that did not make it to the large opportunity to complete dataset, those patients actually especially in MMSE more consistent than the patients that did have a sufficient exposure.

But in the subgroup of exposure patients, which as you think about a third of it, they had a nice benefit. I guess the question is how do you think about the patients you did not have enough exposure, did they drive a strong negative trend? Are those patients at harm?

443,3026,61161,61161,"Hi everybody. And thank you for taking the question. And I’m going to stay with aducanumab here. I’m just kind of struggling with the movement from the Interim Futility Analysis to efficacy with relatively small number of patients. Just looking at the number of completed that you have here in EMERGE, you move from 803 patients in the futility analysis to 980 patients in the treatment. So it’s about 180 more patients. If we assume a third of those were on the high dose, 60 more in your total number of folks that you have amyloid beta that you calls got sufficient exposure is at the end of the trial, 127 I kind of wonder if there is just a very small number of patients that drove the entire movement. If you can discuss a little bit that issue of how many patients actually contribute to the difference between stopping the trial for futility and showing efficacy would be appreciated. And then I’m going to – if you don’t mind going to throw my second one in and it will be different, not to kind of just for the variability. And do you have any way to protecting the highest dose TYSABRI from biosimilars through the first-generation products. If you can discuss that at all, I would appreciate it.

So, to your first question in amyloid plaque reduction, we do believe that PET measurement of amyloid plaque reduction is a very sensitive tool of dose and you’ve correctly identified that ENGAGE at the high dose is showing a lower reduction than in EMERGE and we do believe that, that is a clear reflection of the lower doses that were achieved in that high dosing group in ENGAGE. And the second question was.Paul Matteis: Other measures that function...Samantha Budd Haeberlein: Other measures that function. Yes, so the exploratory analysis that we have demonstrated for you, we focused on the primary endpoint, and we do not have the same analysis for the functional endpoints, but you do have those results for the overall study where even in ENGAGE, we do have some response on the functional scores, albeit not statistically significant.",AID_16,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Mike decided to leave the company on his own and I can cannot thank him enough for his many contributions over the past three and half years to Biogen. So, thanks, Mike. And at the same time I’m extremely confident in Al’s leadership as a clinician too, as a scientist to take the helm at the time where the R&D portfolio never been as stronger, the team also and the capabilities.Al Sandrock: Umar, this is Al Sandrock, and I will turn it over to Samantha later for follow-up. But look, your point is well taken, the low dose is consistent across ENGAGE and EMERGE, and that’s because the particularly the second protocol amendment, really affected the high dose arm of – in the carriers. So in the low dose arm or in the protocol amendments had less of an effect and I think that’s one of the main reasons for the consistency in the results across the two studies. I’ll turn it over to Samantha for a follow-up.Samantha Budd Haeberlein: Yes, that’s correct. Umar you’ll also see that in the high dose for ENGAGE that we do have a partial response on ADAS-Cog13, and the ADCS-ADL-MCI. And so the potential read that you have there on CDR-Sum of Boxes and MMSC is that these are potentially less sensitive as endpoints. So what Al said is that in the high-dose group we know that we have less doses than we – at the high dose than we had in EMERGE, and we also know that the studies were to some degree impacted by dose suspensions due to ARIA, so dosing is a complex combination of duration, magnitude and no interruptions.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
447,3026,58758,58758,"These were good questions Matthew and we’re still learning as we look at the data, but I would say this, the – even in MCI patient, if you look at the amount of amyloid in the brain, it’s tremendous. It took 20 years to build that much up and in the context of an 18 month trial, you have to remove a large amount of amyloid. I think that’s what distinguishes as you aducanumab and BAN2401, is that we can – it’s safe enough to achieve the doses that allow us to remove a large amount of amyloid. And if you don’t remove a large amount, you’re not going to get an effect. Also there is a lag. You remove amyloid, and then there is a little bit of a lag for the clinical effect. We saw that in PRIME for example, where we did have some amyloid lowering of six months, but we saw no difference in the clinical outcomes at six months. It was – it took the 12-month time period to see – to start to see an effect on clinical outcomes. So in addition to a large amount of amyloid removal, I think you need to have a little bit of time for that, for that biological activity to have an effect on clinical outcomes That’s what we see and I would say that if you look at the amyloid-PET results that was on one of the slides and those who had more than 10 doses of 10 milligrams, you can see that the SUVR score is very similar in ENGAGE in that subgroup of patients in ENGAGE to the EMERGE total dataset. So – and so again, what it says is that if you give it enough of the high dose, you can achieve a certain amount of amyloid removal and that certain amount is what’s required to see the reduction in clinical decline in an 18 month study.Samantha Budd Haeberlein: Yes, Al just add to that, on the question of numbers. On the graph that you’ve just referred to, you got the end numbers. So they were 147 for EMERGE and 116 for ENGAGE in that CDR-Sum of Boxes analysis. But the question you ask of how many patients have the precise criteria? Well there aren’t precise criteria. Dose response is not binary. And so, given the levels of dose you have a different response and it’s a bit of a sliding scale. So we have that exploratory analysis that we disclosed to explain what it is we learned around the importance of dose, but there is no perfect number of doses that are required, it’s not binary.",AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Different markets require different rather than just CPU, GPU our FPGA, there is a new class of workload that require different type of processor and then we are also driving the memory, the storage, the infrastructure in terms of able to cope with the data, massive, massive explosion of data.And then, so, all this is going to require new innovation in order to support that and for example the programmability, the scale out the storage and network and then scale out the top of the rack, all the way to topping on the spy in term of the infrastructure 12.8 terabit per second to 51.2 terabit per second switch and all the high-speed interconnecting.And that's why the SerDes is so important for high speed.

And so, we are excited about that and then, meanwhile, we just announced our Celsius Thermal Solver. Again back to that computational software strength that we have and we clearly demonstrate that up to 10 X performance and customers are delighted to see our performance especially Bosh and Arm, they both endorse our new products and we have made up earlier discussions. So it’s still in a very early stage of our emerging into the System Analysis and more and more our customer love that, because beside the EDA, beside the IP, they want to look at the total system solution simulation whether it fits the whole system, power, thermal, envelopes and it’s something that we can really demonstrate and provide the best solution for the customer.",AID_4,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

I mean we assume gross margin comes out at about 90% in our estimates and we did better in Q3.It came out - I think was 91.6% and we landed at 31.7% for op margin. So most of the – but most of the beat on the op margin side in Q3 was a result of gross margins. My expectation for Q4 is that, we have a significant hardware pipeline heading into Q4. It was kind of similar, it reminds me of where we were this time last year and last year, our gross margin ticked down, I think 200 basis points from Q3 to Q4.So we are expecting about 30%. And that's because you've got a combination of things happening, right? You've got Q3 and Q4 we are assuming that that there is no change in export limitations right now.

We have a guide of 115 to 145, but those are not concrete barriers, right. It's just a guide there. We are going to do the right thing for the business.So for example, in this situation, in the current environment, even though we have decreased those wafer starts, it is likely that we go above the top of that range or it's at least possible that we do just because of where the revenue midpoint is. Now we are not going to go drive the wafer starts in a draconian way to just to stay within those guidelines.That would not make sense in one quarter.

So first, let me remind you, of course when it comes to CapEx, particularly for that fab, it's all about driving long term revenue growth and extending our manufacturing advantage, including 300 millimeter.

Once we build that, that will enable us to build the building for the next 300 millimeter factory. Our plan continues to be to build that building within the next few years.And as a reminder, that will cost $600 million to $700 million over a couple of years as we build that building. And $600 million to $700 million, it is a sizable amount. But the big expense comes from the equipment that would follow.

But even on that call, you had guided Q4 2018 down about 12% sequentially which was obviously below. We are a later. We have had a number of rounds of cuts. So the base is even lower and now you are guiding Q4 2019 down by 50% sequentially. So it's even worse on a sequential basis than we saw in the year ago quarter when we started. I guess it's and again it's not like things have been weak all along. I guess if you can give us some kind of an indication, maybe what could get immediately worse? Is this your Huawei pull-forward working off? Is this something going on because your distribution strategy is different from your competitors?

We did lower wafer starts in third quarter inside of the quarter and we are lowering those further into fourth quarter. And that's a capital allocation decision. When we do that we save cash, right. And we have, to a larger degree, built the buffer strategy that we have talked about. So we will save cash as we do that and that makes sense for the owners of the company.

We talk about one of our competitive advantages being diversity and longevity. Our biggest the product last year, as an example, was about 0.8% of our total revenue.

We still have about two-thirds of our revenue supported by consignment overall. So we know that inventory remains at zero because of those consignment programs.

We have close to 100,000 different customers and we sell about 100,000 different products. It's difficult to pinpoint any one thing. But the sense we get talking to those customers, getting input from them, from our salespeople and all the touch points that we have is that the weakness is broad-based, is due to macro events and specifically the trade tensions.And if you think about when there is tensions in trade and obstacles to trade, what do businesses do? They become more cautious and they pull back. And we are at the very end of our long supply chain and when the ones at the very front pullback, it becomes a traffic jam. So our sense is that is what's happening in the marketplace.

I know one quarter doesn't necessarily make a trend, but you guys have been ridiculously consistent in a positive way with your buyback over time. I know you raised the dividend this last quarter. But I think the share repurchase was the lowest since I believe the second quarter of 2012, if my model is right. And the aggregate of the two, the dividend and the buyback, were meaningfully less than the free cash flow in the quarter.

When I look at how your analog business trending, it's about in line with our expectations and quite frankly, what your peer group is doing. But when I look at embedded, it seems to be demonstrably worse. In fact, if Q4 is down sequentially equally across all segments, you will be down peak to trough this cycle in embedded, more so than you were in the 2009 financial crisis when financial markets weren't working properly and companies couldn't actually get funding for inventory. So I just want to kind of go back and kind of understand why you think the embedded business is doing so poorly relative to overall kind of industry trends?

But that weakness was just more pronounced directionally the same but just more pronounced in embedded. And you know, we did see and if you look now just inside of embedded, we saw a more pronounced weakness in automotive and in communications.

Are there no intricate parties, any color on why that would take longer than StubHub given you kind of started the whole process at the same time? And the second one is your revenue and margin outlook for next year makes a lot of sense, and can you walk us through again what those 700 basis points of EPS headwind are taxing a few other things, but typically your EPS would grow faster than operating income.

558,3030,3268,3268,"Yes, sure. Thanks for the question, Eric. Let me just kind of take the construct here. So, the internet sales tax laws that have kind of rolled across the country over the past year, as we've called out the last few quarters, have been a headwind. And the U.S., and remember first off, the U.S. business is 40% of the Marketplace business so that's where we're feeling that pressure, and while it doesn't fundamentally create a competitive disadvantage, what it does do is hurt small sellers whose buyers when they see the prices have to pay up to 9% more for their items. So it's really less about brining new buyers, and it's really less about sellers listing items. It's just in that flow, particularly for higher dollar items is where we see buyers abandon the cart at checkout because they're like, ""Oh, wait a second, why is it more?"" depending on the sales tax that were being added. Now, like I said, it doesn't fundamentally create a competitive disadvantage, but for a period of time as it rolls out across the different states, because remember this is rolling out state by state, and I'll let Andy talk to that in a second, but as that rolls out and as we assess user behaviors, which are a little bit different state to state depending on the magnitude of the sales tax, et cetera, we're just seeing different behaviors.

I was just wondering if you could give us a bit of a sense, looking at the 180 basis points in leverage in sales and marketing in the quarter, how will you think about driving further leverage in that line relative to investing in growth in GMV? And are the limitations in marketing a function of ROI or conversion rates preventing you from doing that or is it something else. And then just a short one on StubHub, what kind of impact would you say digital ticketing is having? I know there have been some pretty significant developments there just in the last quarter.

As we've talked about over the last couple of months, if you think about the managed delivery aspects that we've been working on, broadly speaking, what we're trying to do is solve customer pain points, right. We're looking at a number of different aspects to try and resolve what customers are thinking as problems. For sellers it's making sure that they have access to lower cost faster shipping alternatives. And for buyers, it's making sure that we illuminate that value for them as we look forward.

565,3030,12050,12050,"Yes, look, first off on payments. Look, we feel great about our execution. Quite frankly, we've seen accelerated adoption, as we talked about, in the U.S. Germany has launched successfully. Since a year ago it's quite amazing. We've actually enabled over $1 billion of GMV as we've talked about and as you called out. You know 20,000 sellers is a lot. Now, we've processed really up to the limit that we can for the next six months, seven months until we get to the -- or actually a little bit longer, till we get to the end of the operating agreement, in July of next year. and when we do that we're preparing to ramp after that. And we'll continue to ramp in Germany over the next six to nine months. The feedback, the feedback remains strong. Look, sellers love a simpler experience that's paying them directly into their bank account and saving them money, all right. I mean what's not to like. And so as we continue to expand this globally we're going to be adding more forms of payment like SEPA Direct Debit, like we called out for Germany, and really being in the position of being able to offer more choices for our consumers. Specific to what the Board is looking for, look, I'll just say, right now we're heads down on making sure that we focus on our priorities for 2019 and deliver the numbers that we committed to you guys and to our investors.

I think, we have to be very careful with how we architect the user experience to make sure that the sellers that are only that offer listings that it comes up in a natural search way. Interesting flow, if we don't want it to become an all-encompassing promoted listings only type of search results. That said, there's a lot of opportunity that was called out and I won't necessarily rehash each of those, but from placements to alternative forms of monetization to merchandising and things like that. So we're very -- we remain very excited about first party. In the meantime, absolutely third-party ads, particularly display ads will reduce even further and will provide some headwinds in that advertising number for another year or two, and on a material basis, and so as we look at getting to that billion dollars, it's going to be a balance of making sure that the user experience with our first party promoted listings ad product works great and that it improves the user experience, doesn't hurt it and that third-party ads, how quickly it unwinds.

575,3030,9465,9465,"Yes, first on the 180 basis points. Look, for this year, as we talked about, we had raised really over the course of 2017, particularly latter half of '17 and '18, our amount of marketing spend as we turn, pushing the boundaries of CLV and ROIs to try and learn what type of cohorts we'd bring in during that time and how they would mature. And 2019 was really about just kind of re-leveling that amount, and removing particularly the lower ROI, A lot of that ending up in contra, as we've talked about in the past. As we think about the future we'll continue to look at our marketing spend, everything from brand down to paid search, and really take a look at critically where the spend is, what type of returns we're seeing, as we always do, year-to-year. And then -- and also look at how we might diversify and really expand. We haven't made as much progress on social as we would've liked. How do we spend an iterate there, who do we continue to optimize around our paid search efforts, where and how do we deploy our brand spend, and how do we sharpen our brand message to make the branding efforts that we do do be more effective? And so it's just really around optimizing, but I don't really look at as much of a takeout next year in our outlook, and thus don't really expect the less high quality GMV to deceleration that we had this year to repeat to some extent. But we're going to be pressurizing our marketing spend, to the question. On the digital ticketing, yes, absolutely, this is quarter-to-quarter, it's a competitive battle. Since 95% of the business, or more, is in the U.S. we have to really stay on top of the capabilities. I think Sukhinder and the team have done an excellent job at integrating digital ticketing and making it as seamless as possible depending on the venue, the league, the performer, et cetera.

And what went live in October were 11 additional states, including a couple of big ones, in California and Texas. So that'll give you a little indication of how to think about that impact impacting the U.S. and impacting the business in the fourth quarter. And then in terms of the year-over-year impact, clearly the full load of that fourth quarter playing through the first three quarters next year will have an impact, and that's what I had included in the discussion around the 2020 guide with roughly two points of revenue impact for the full-year.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

As I think anyone would expect, this is done by carefully assessing the strategic competitive and operational dynamics for every business, and we've done this carefully and diligently. And it also gets into, as you little bit call out, how the businesses are integrated with systems people and processes, and all of the dynamics that you mentioned.

582,3030,7419,7419,"Okay. And on the 700 basis points, the three key drivers, tax rate, OI&E primarily interest income, and FX, I'll handle each of those just with little more detail. On tax rate, our ongoing normal tax rate is probably somewhere in the range of 15.5% to 17.5%. We'll finish this year at about 15% if we deliver on the Q4 guide which is a little below the midpoint of that range. And so there's a small impact from that included. In terms of OI&E, we entered the year with close to $9 billion of cash, we'll exit close to the target that we've been talking about all year, about $3.5 billion. That's a relatively large reduction in cash balances, and therefore interest income, and that will have an impact on earnings growth on a year-over-year basis. And then the final piece if Fx, you'll recall we hedge currencies 12 to 18 months in advance. The impact of the dollar strengthening late last year has been somewhat muted in our results through this year given the hedges we had in place. And as we roll forward into 2019 some of the benefit of those hedge gains will not be in the P&L.

One of the reasons are we've had some increased costs on costs of sales is kind of prepping data centers to catch information going back and forth.

591,3031,17150,17150,"John Rainey: Sure, David. This is John. I’ll address that. So when we announced the delay in those initiatives initially on the last call, I think it’s fair to say that we probably erred on the side of conservatism as we thought about the back half of the year and that they are both, specifically the Paymentus initiative as well as the price initiatives, they are both performing moderately better than what we expected at that point in time in terms of the pace of the integration of each of those. And we do expect to have a benefit as we have a full – as those are rolled in at the beginning of next year and we get – for the vast majority of the year get the full run rate benefit of each of those. With respect to pricing, that’s been rolled out in three countries in Q4 and we’ll expand that further into next year. And as a reminder, this is with respect to refund pricing and in line with industry practice, we don’t charge fees to process refunds, but also in line with industry practice we are retaining the fixed and the variable piece of that and certain merchants are excluded if you have negotiated pricing and so forth, but those are performing as expected. But as we look at 2020, we’ll go live with additional merchants and we will have additional price changes, always looking to price to the value that we create for our customer base as we offer expanded capabilities and experiences for them we want to be able to price to that as well.Dan Schulman: I would just say, David that pricing is an ongoing process for us. We had certain things baked into our plans and we were late on those. We had certain expectations on integration especially into Paymentus and we were late on those. It’s one of the reasons why I’m really happy with the performance of so many people on the PayPal team. They were really laser-focused on getting those implemented in the right way. And these are complicated integrations and we want to make sure that we’re fully transparent in the way we roll these things out. And so I’m pretty pleased with the way the team stepped up and addressed all of that. As John mentioned, I think on the Paymentus side, we’ll have full stack integration live by the end of the year. And then we start to roll in, Paymentus has almost 1,500 billers, we want to roll in all of those billers into a bill pay app right on the PayPal app and that will take into the first and second quarter before we have that completed, but the full stack integration on to our Braintree platform will happen by the end of the year. Pricing, just to reiterate what John said, pricing is an ongoing process for us. We’re going to have pricing initiatives this year, next year, the year after and then the year after that. I mean we continually assess market dynamics. We look at the evolving practices of our competitors. We take a hard look at the value we provide. And then we try to price appropriately based on all those factors. And yes, we price sometimes up, sometimes we take prices down, it depends on product, it depends on corridors, it depends on regions in the world, but we’re very considered about it. We do have some degree of latitude in all of those things. And right now, I think John and I are both pretty pleased where we are.",AID_6,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
592,3031,23895,23895,"Dan Schulman: Yes. Those are all good questions, Heath. And I think actually, Heath, given the extent of that question, we'll probably end after this. So first of all, obviously it's incredibly meaningful event to be the first non-Chinese company obtain a payments license to process domestic online payments in China. It's a tangible example of China opening its financial market. We have been working this diligently for years. When I say diligent, I mean literally almost every single day we've had calls and have been working this. And we worked quite closely with the PBOC, with other authorities inside of China. We worked with the administration here to enable all this to happen. And then I think what we've demonstrated across the globe and I think was appreciated by various entities within China is our ability to work closely with regulators. We've invested quite heavily in compliance and risk management and we're a strong collaborator with the financial ecosystem. We're much more partners with the financial ecosystem than go around the financial ecosystem and be a disruptor. We're innovative, but we're partners with the existing structure. And so I think all of that combined in a very good working relationship and many years of that enabled this event to happen. It's obviously pretty significant for us. It obviously increases our total addressable market quite substantially. China is the world's largest e-commerce market. I think there is something like 500 million online shoppers and they're going to drive something like $2 trillion of online sales this year, which is more than 50% of global online retail. And China is obviously an advanced and sophisticated digital marketplace, but we believe that we can offer a quite differentiated value proposition to both Chinese merchants and consumers by working closely with Chinese financial institutions, various tech platforms inside of China to connect sort of their vast commerce ecosystem with sort of our vast network of consumers and merchants outside of China. And so this is actually a substantial – substantially more than what we can do right now. So for instance, think of before we cannot work with companies and allow Chinese consumers to purchase from PayPal merchants outside of China and now we can start to facilitate that, working again in partnership with Chinese tech platforms and/or Chinese financial institutions. We can take Chinese merchants who may want – may be want to sell on other platforms and do payouts back into China through cross-border, we'll be able to enable that through our platform. Multinationals that are doing business in China can use our platform to enable their transactions and for us to process those digital payments coming across there. So, a lot of people are focusing just on the domestic consumer part of China, there's obviously opportunities there working in connection with partners inside of China, but there is a tremendous amount that we leverage, kind of the strength of our network and the strength of the vast commerce ecosystem inside China, which is significantly digital and that we think affords us some pretty significant opportunities over at least the medium to long-term. So we're quite excited about the opportunity. We'll give a lot more details as we go into next year as the transaction closes and we'll make sure that we continue to update everybody on this. So, again, Heath, thank you for that question.",AID_8,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
593,3031,4369,4369,"Thanks, Brian. Good to speak with you. I’d say the debt issuance was perhaps two-fold. One, it was opportunistic. And two, it gives us more flexibility. Opportunistic in the sense that it’s just it was a good time to tap into the debt markets. I talked about the various tranches of our debt and we literally secure 10-year debt at less than 3%. And so that’s a very attractive rate for us and we’ve got ample opportunities to allocate that capital. And it does give us more flexibility given our strategic initiatives. But there is not – don’t read into that and that there is a change and how we’re thinking about capital allocation. So as a reminder, we said when we provided our medium-term guidance that we expect over that time frame of approximately five years that we would spend 40% to 45% of our free cash flow to buy back stock and that we would spend between $1 billion and $3 billion in M&A activity. Now that’s not necessarily each year, but that’s on average over that period of time. This allows us the flexibility to do that. And importantly, as you think about the cash generating ability of our business, we will generate $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year, but that comes sort of ratably throughout the year. Going and tapping into the debt markets at this point in time gives us the opportunity to access that cash on our timing versus when we’re earning that cash throughout the year. So no change to our plans. We still believe that effective capital allocation supports and contributes to long-term value creation and this was really just an opportunity to tap into the debt markets to get to a more optimal capital structure as we’ve suggested for some time that gives us more flexibility.Dan Schulman: Maybe, I can just a quick add on to John’s great answer there. I think on the M&A front, we obviously have quite a strong balance sheet right now some $13 billion of cash and as John mentioned, generating about $3.5 billion of free cash flow this year. We have stated that we will be acquisitive. We look at some 200 to 300 companies every quarter. We will over time and on average, as John mentioned, spend somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion. We anticipate on acquisitions, last year was a light year, but you should expect us to be acquisitive. Those acquisitions would obviously any revenues that come from would be additive to our 2020 plans. We’re at 17% organic. And I think we would do – we’d be on top of that. And we’re continuing to look at capabilities that would improve things like consumer engagement. We would look at geographic expansion opportunities. GoPay would be a good example of that scale and scope with different partners; MELI and Uber would be good examples of that. And so no change in our capital allocation, but you should expect us to use our balance sheet in areas that would complement our internal development efforts and allow us to continue to seize growth opportunities, where we see them.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

598,3031,551,552," So maybe I’ll start off with that and then turn it over to John. We’re quite pleased with the revenue growth that we had in the third quarter and really what we expect in fourth quarter and going into 2020. So there are a couple of things, and you’re right, these are before pricing initiatives really come to play as well as our full integration with Paymentus. Our net new actives and our engagement are really beginning to kick in and start to drive incremental growth in our revenues. We had records in net new actives for the quarter, almost 10 million. You’ve got engagement going up again by another 9% to 40 times a year. Just those couple of things are really starting to put more and more acceleration in. And what we’re beginning to see right now is that sales into our back book and a lot of sales into the front book are coming in much more strong than we’ve ever had before. We’re just winning more business right now. There is a bit of a network effect going on. We have most 300 million active accounts now. Merchants understand the scale we have. They want to be a part of that. We do start to see right now the beginnings of our capabilities of selling as a platform provider and not just a product. So as I mentioned with payouts in my earnings script, we’re seeing that really start to take hold. We’re really starting to see a lot more full stack processing start to take hold. And so we’re having a lot more incremental product sales both in the back book as well as in the front book including just basic things like presentment of the PayPal button where it’s presented. Given the scale we have now, merchants are putting us into more and more prime positions at presentment. Partnerships are beginning to kick in right now. We now have nine out of the top 10 U.S. banks working with us. The marketplaces outside of eBay, they have over $100 billion of TPV right now growing at 36% with us. And so we’re really beginning to see a bend in the curve in our core organic PayPal growth and that is really encouraging for us. And then of course, yes, Venmo rapidly growing its monetization efforts right now. We’re really pleased with that. And I think what we’re equally as pleased with is we see a lot of good runway in front of Venmo as well.John Rainey: I would just add. As Dan suggested, we’re seeing good trends across many aspects of our business. I think it’s important to remember for the first part of this year, at least the first three quarters we’ve had some more difficult comps with things like cross-border with some currency effects and things like that. And so we are sort of lapping some of the beginning impacts of that, not that I think the currency environment seems to be getting much improved from where it was. But with respect to the couple of things that you alluded to around Paymentus and pricing, we are live with both of those. There is a metered ramp on each of them. So we’ve launched in three countries on the pricing initiative that we’ve referred to previously. And not to overly fixate on that, because we make pricing changes all the time, but I know there were some questions about that given our last call. And Paymentus, we’re excited about the progress that we’re making there. We’re ramping up in the fourth quarter. And as I noted in my remarks, we expect to be complete with each of those by the early part of next year.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
599,3031,8170,8170,"Hey, Jason. So, on eBay, there’s a couple of dynamics going on there. The – our expectation right now is that eBay is about fully ramped to the 10% that they’re allowed in each of the two entities that where they’re doing managed payments, which are Germany and the U.S. So, going into the back half of next year, we would expect that those would ramp much more appreciably as they’re already live in those markets. There is a more or our expectation anyway is that there is a more metered ramp for when they launch in some of these other geographies, which is consistent with kind of what we’ve seen in the first two geographies, where they’ve launched. I think also related to that is our expectation about what share of checkout we retain. And based upon what we’ve seen in both Germany and the U.S., it’s consistent to what we said back in January of 2018 around our expectations there. So, each of those elements influences our expectation around eBay, but obviously, that’s an estimate at this point in time and that can change, and we will first question let you know if something does.Dan Schulman: John, just before you get to that part, let me maybe, expand a little bit on eBay. So Jason, I think obviously, there is going to be an important and strategic partner with us for a long time to come, but it’s obviously shrinking in terms of its overall volumes and its impacts on our financials. It’s been three quarters in a row, where they’ve had negative TPV growth. Yes, they’re negative 3%, outside of that. we’re growing at 31% in our TPV. And we think at the end of the OA, they’re going to be down to about 6% of our overall TPV volumes. And if you think about it, like when we initially split from eBay, TPV, their percentage of TPV was around 20%, now it’s dropped down to about 8%. If you look at their revenues, the revenues have dropped in half as a percent overall. And so I think it’s really worth noting that while all of that’s been happening, our revenues have been growing on average, call it 18% to 20% during that timeframe. Our margins have been going up. And so they’re obviously a much smaller part of PayPal than we expected when we were first thinking about the OA. And therefore the transition at the end of the OA is going to be much less of an impact, much more manageable and we think that 1% of revenue growth impact is probably a pretty reasonable expectation. I’d say nothing in their intermediated payouts. Right now, it gives me any incremental cause for concern. I mean maybe, even the opposite. They need regulatory approvals in all of the countries that they’re going to roll out into. There is going to be a long tail that that’s going to be hard to get to. China is obviously going to be an interesting discussion item on that. Merchants are increasingly beginning to sell on multiple platforms right now and they’re using PayPal One Touch activation to do that. And so they’re quite tight into PayPal. And we are seeing the PayPal share of checkout on intermediated payments rising significantly. And so you put all of those into place along with the growth that we’re seeing in other marketplaces and our ability to start to work with some marketplaces that we weren’t able to our work with before. And we think this is going to be a very manageable transition and we hope to be close partners with eBay as we go through that.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame
600,3031,12637,12637,"Sure, Darrin. So, a couple of things; one, as we look at the outperformance in the quarter, we provide a range of estimates around revenue and earnings, and we came in at the higher end of that range that we expected. So, the revenue outperformance is one of the bigger drivers within the quarter for how we perform. But as you noted, we also performed very well on the expense side. I think it’s – I’ll our caution you about assuming that that level of sales and marketing is a run rate basis. There are a number of initiatives going on there as we go to market in a different way that have affected that quarter. And so that’s just kind of a side point. But the general point around operating margin leverage and what we can do there, this is a very sustainable initiative for us. And you’ll remember, Darrin, a couple of years ago when we first started this, the work in this area, there were some question about was this a one-time cost take out or was this really sustainable. I hope that we’re beginning to allay the concerns around people about the sustainability of that. This is perhaps the best performance that we’ve ever seen in any particular quarter, growing our organic cost, non-transaction related costs at 1.9%. And this is really just – well, if you remember, I described it at the time as we were re-plumbing our business or rewiring our business to be able to grow at a very low marginal cost. And it’s literally in every aspect of the business, but I’ll give you one example that maybe will really give you a flavor of how these are coming about. So we obviously have a significant number of calls that come in each month in our call center, five million on average per month. And we aspire to be able to address each of those issues that our customers have and to be on the phone with or not have them have to wait on the phone, but we’re not perfect. And if you go back to last December, we had 33,000 calls that a customer had to wait over 45 minutes. I looked right before I came in here today and in the month of October we have 526 calls. Now that’s a dramatic improvement, but what’s noteworthy about that is we achieved that without adding a single human being to address that problem. Those were all issues around schedule efficiency, better routing when someone goes into the IVR, things like that. It just enables us to provide a better customer experience, but at the same time lower our cost. And in the scheme of five million calls a month, 33,000 is maybe not a lot, but each of those customers has an experience and that impacts whether they use us again, whether they churn in the future. So it’s things like that that drive dramatic improvements in our business both on the cost line, but also what it can do for the customer experience as well.Dan Schulman: I had a couple of things to add, Darrin that I think are really important. First of all, things that you don’t see that are really important to us are things like what are we doing with developer tool sets, our development platform, which makes our engineers so much more productive. Before we would have to hire a lot of people that just couldn’t get their code through and now we have tool sets and an environment that is much more efficient, maybe two times the efficiency that we had before. Things like losses as we grow bigger and our transaction volume becomes larger, our ability to do machine learning on that combined with the acquisition we did of Simility, those losses now are at a lower level that we think continues as well and probably may even improve as we get larger. And finally, I would just say Venmo. Venmo used to have more and more money that we would have to put into Venmo each year as a group and it is now, instead of a drain on our margin structure, help on our margin structure as we go forward and I would expect that to continue to happen. And so all-in, I think we feel pretty good about the leverage of the model and it’s why we have such strong confidence around that 20% compounding annually EPS number.Operator: Thank you.

601,3031,21140,21140,"John Rainey: Sure, Lisa. It's good to speak with you. So as we think about our credit strategy, obviously you're very familiar with what we did with the U.S. consumer loan portfolio when we sold that $6 billion portfolio and now we have a partnership with Synchrony going forward. That's a strategy that we like because it's very much asset light. When we look at the opportunities for credit in our business both on the merchant side as well as international consumer, they are significant growth opportunities. And we think that particularly like when we look at the merchant lending, that's where our value proposition shines when we can provide working capital loans, understanding the seasonality and the cyclicality of a merchant's business in a way that others can't with access to some of their payment flows. And so we want to continue to grow that. But what we don't want and again we've demonstrated this with our past experience, we don't want credit to become too capital intensive to where it takes away from other opportunities that we have. And so I do think that OVAS revenue and specifically credit revenue can continue to grow at a rate higher than overall TPV for PayPal. So I think that's definitely true. But if you look at our total credit receivables today, there are about $3.5 billion inclusive of both merchant and international consumer, far or less roughly half of what the U.S. consumer credit receivables were for us when we sold those and we were a much smaller company then as well. And so we will get to a point seemingly given the opportunity that's in front of us on credit where we will likely go asset light with some of one or both of those portfolios as well.

The part that we've worked very hard on is controlling the cost of Model Y, and our steady state forecast for that program puts the cost at roughly equivalent to Model 3.There will be ramp in efficiencies at first, of course, as we launch the program, but as it stabilizes with steady state production, we do expect that it will be a higher margin product.

To be totally frank, we're continuing to make them more for sentimental reasons than anything else. They're really of minor importance to the future.Pierre Ferragu: Okay. That makes sense. And then, my question...Elon Musk: They're great cars. The Model S I think if you want -- I mean, the Model S literally won Motor Trend's best car ever in history by the way. I think if you're out there and you're buying -- and you're going to buy a Model S, I think you just made a mistake, to be totally frank. It's incredible, especially the new one with variable damping suspension, hospital operating room, HEPA filter for air purification, the raven powertrain.It's the fastest car in the world, and it's just so easy to drive. It makes you feel like Superman driving that car. It's incredibly safe. It's just an amazing vehicle. And then, Model S, I think, is like Faberge egg of cars. I mean, not Model X. Model X is like the Faberge egg of cars. Yeah, that's why so many artists and musicians buy the car. It's an art piece basically.Zachary Kirkhorn: Yeah, just to add -- I agree. They're absolutely phenomenal cars. And we are increasing production on our S and X lines for this quarter in response to increasing demand. And so, I think part of the story here is, as we have launched, ramped and stabilized Model 3, that's kind of consumed a lot of the attention around the company.But now as that has stabilized, we're able to focus our attention and balance that between S and X and Model 3. So, the delivery numbers in Q3 understated the interest in the product for that quarter. And we continue to see strength in the order rate, which we anticipate will be reflected in S and X deliveries in Q4.Elon Musk: I mean, Model S -- basic Model S at this point has a range of 370 miles. Actually, technically it's 373, but we actually certified it incorrectly as 370, but it's 373. And there are some software improvements that we think will make that even better.I forgot to mention, we're also expecting there's going to be an over-the-air improvement that will improve the power of the Model S, X, and 3. That's, by the way coming in a few weeks. Should be in the order of 5% power improvement due to improved firmware. Drew, do you want to say anything on that?Drew Baglino: Yeah, we just continue to learn how to optimize the motor control in our products. And yeah, so 5% improvement for all Model 3 customers and 3% for S and X.Elon Musk: Yeah, and there's also the single pedal driving that will improve the range as well.Drew Baglino: Very excited about that. It's an improvement in comfort and feel.Elon Musk: Yeah, it's easier to drive. And it improves the range.Drew Baglino: Yes. And faster super charging.Elon Musk: Faster super charging, yeah.Drew Baglino: For Standard Range and Standard Range Plus customers, which is a big deal.Elon Musk: I don't think there's ever been a situation in history where you buy a car and it gets way better over time just through the software. Not a little bit better, but a lot.Drew Baglino: It's very exciting, I think. Yeah. As a customer myself, I enjoy these updates. I always look forward to them.Elon Musk: Yeah, might move the Model S range to almost 380 or high 370s with the update.Zachary Kirkhorn: And we're not stopping to work there.

You've got high-speed autonomy on the highway, and intermediate speed autonomy, which really just means traffic lights and stop signs.So feature-complete means it's most likely able to do that without intervention, without human intervention, but it would still be supervised. And I've gone through this timeline before several times, but it is often misconstrued that there's three major levels to autonomy. There's the car being able to be autonomous, but requiring supervision and intervention at times. That's feature complete. Then there's -- and it doesn't mean like every scenario, everywhere on earth, including ever corner case, it just means most of the time.And then, there's another level which is that we think it's -- that from a Tesla standpoint, we think the car is safe enough to be driven without supervision.

I think we're very encouraged as a team at the reception of our products as more and more people become aware of electric vehicles.I think competitive products help raise that awareness, and overall interest is just increasing. So our focus internally is to increase production as fast as we can both with the existing equipment and accelerating our timelines on new capacity. We believe that everybody should be driving an electric car, so we need to move as quickly as we can.Elon Musk: Yeah, absolutely. We want to get the Tesla volume to where it is perhaps somewhere on the order of 1%, replacing 1% of the global fleet over time. That's, I think, the global fleet is pretty big. We think that's a good one to aim for, which is about 20 million vehicles a year, just by the way.But I do think that the demand for new cars will rise as the world transitions away from combustion engine vehicles, just as when people had CRT TVs, there's no cathode ray tube TVs, the sales rate was just basically replacement rate. You wouldn't really buy a new CRT TV unless yours broke.But when flat screens came out, there was a big step change in demand because now getting a big flat screen TV was much better than having a small CRT TV.

635,3032,30802,30803," Yeah, I can provide a couple of comments on that. On your final -- on your last question about China headwinds, there are always ramp inefficiencies when we launch a new factory. So we don't expect China to be any different than that. So there will be some that we experience in Q4.The amount of that is hard to forecast, given that it's a different type of factory design than we did here in Fremont. We're working very hard to limit the ramp inefficiencies, but first question fixed cost absorption and having all of the labor ready as we ramp will have an impact on Q4.On the margin improvement, a couple of things there for Auto gross margin. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, S and X average selling prices increased from Q2 to Q3. I mean, that's important, as I mentioned in the last earnings call. The prior powertrain versions of S and X provided significant headwinds on average selling price for that product in the quarter.We've also done a bunch of work as a company to become more targeted in how we adjust pricing on our products and how we optimize that based on local supply and demand. And so, I think there is a bunch of good work from the team on that in Q3, which we allude to in our financials.And cost reduction has just remained a huge focus for us. It's hard to underestimate how much of that has been engrained in the culture of the company. And Jerome and his team have done absolutely tremendous work there. So, on every line item of our cost, whether it be manufacturing, labor, warehousing, logistics, there's just a tremendous amount of good work that happened there.Specifically, on nonrecurring items, two that I'll note, one being the Smart Summon revenue recognition, debatable whether that's considered recurring or not given that we continue to expect to release more features and release revenue associated with that in the future, but we did want to call that out specifically and the dollar value around that because we know there's been speculation around the impact for the quarter. And foreign exchange is just something that since we don't hedge, it has an impact, and it comes and goes every quarter.

It's not -- it's not exactly a giant percentage.

And we're also working very hard to get other states lined up in the States, and then also to launch in some countries internationally. So we're not able to provide specific timelines on those changes, but we're definitely working as quickly as we can, given how well received Tesla Insurance has been in California.\nElon Musk: Yeah, I think it also has a secondary effect of insuring that the third-party providers of insurance provide reasonable rates to our customers.\nZachary Kirkhorn: Completely agree. The goal here is not to have an outsized market share of insurance, it's just to make sure that their customers have an alternative to other companies, as well, if those rates are high.

643,3032,18395,18395," I think there is generally a lack of understanding or appreciation for the growth of Tesla Energy, as Kunal was talking about. In the long term, I expect Tesla Energy to be of the same or roughly the same size as Tesla's automotive sector or business. This is the most underappreciated group. I think it could be bigger, but it's first question of a similar magnitude to Tesla Solar. Meaning, if you take Tesla Solar plus battery stuff, Tesla Energy is, I think, the least appreciated element.And part of it is like, for about 18 months, almost two years, we had to divert a tremendous amount of resources. We had to basically take resources from everywhere else in the company and apply them to the Model 3 production -- fixing the Model 3 production ramp and simplifying the design of the Model 3.So, for about a year-and-a-half, we unfortunately stripped Tesla Energy of engineering and other resources and even took the cell production lines that were meant for Powerwall and Powerpack and redirected them to the car because we didn't have enough cells.Now that we feel that Model 3 production is in a good place and headed to a great place, we've restored resources to Tesla Solar and storage. And so that's going to be, I think, the really crazy growth for as far into the future as I can imagine. And but we had to do it because if we didn't solve Model 3, Tesla wouldn't survive. So unfortunately, that shorted pretty much the other parts of the company.But it would be difficult for me to overstate the degree to which, I think, Tesla Energy is going to be a major part of Tesla's activity in the future. And Tesla's mission from the beginning has been to accelerate the advent of sustainable energy, that means sustainable energy generation and sustainable energy consumption in the form of vehicles, electric vehicles.And I think one of the stats we will publish in the future along with our vehicle production is that how much sustainable energy Tesla produced, or Tesla customers produced with our products. And I think you'll see that we're producing about the same or comparable amounts of sustainable energy as are consumed in the car -- in our cars.Because for the longest time, the rebuttal against electric cars is like, don't they use dirty power from coal? Well, no, we're solar power. Obviously the solar power came from companies, not just Tesla. Yeah, sustainable generation and sustainable consumption, and that's what we're doing.

And there are segments where customers are in lower-end packages, the skinny bundled video that -- and often, they're in promotional packages, and we work hard retaining customers. But if we can't profitably serve this segment, then we're going to move them to a broadband-only relationship. And so not chasing the lower end of the video segment is behind the difference, I think, in the video results.To also remind folks, though, that we added a record 309,000 total customer relationships in Q3, ending the quarter at 31 million customer relationships, up 3.4% year-over-year.

Advertising markets in Europe, as you know, are pretty much all under pressure with mid-single digit, perhaps a little bit more declines year-on-year. That's quite different from what you're seeing, I think, in the U.S. at the moment. And probably the balance of it is really down to gaming legislation change here, which is specific to the U.K. and Italy, how we've arrived in Germany. And we're probably disproportionately affected by that, of course, because we've got such a strong sports business and the sports leader in Europe. That will work its way through over the course of this year.In terms of content sales, year-on-year, they're up. So the progress we're making in content sales, as we start to commission more of our own content, is good. It is down quarter-on-quarter, but there's nothing structural now. It's just a bit lumpy.

So Vedula, we really thought it was important to keep it in our portfolio because I think that the value of existing gas assets is only going to grow and this is a CC plant that we modeled very, very conservatively.

And so our plan is always to put them in rate base. In the case of Mankato, the department and ultimately the commission decided that the benefits were too back-end loaded, some variances in how we modeled those benefits and they decided that they didn't want it in rate base. However, we still believe it's a very valuable asset and that it belongs in our portfolio. So we went forward with a non-regulated base approach. But Angie, this isn't a change in strategy or anything else. We always want to see this. We wouldn't bring something to our commissions that we didn't think had a customer benefit.

I don't think the barrier to getting transmission done, which is really what we are trying to get accomplished, is not about the competitive process In fact, if you look at the biggest transmission build, it was done with CapEx 2020, as I mentioned. And that was utilities of all sizes and municipalities and co-ops coming together to form a plan that works with an idea of how cost would be allocated because the real barriers to getting transmission build is, who pays for it and then of course the permitting and everything else that goes with that.So I think my personal opinion, Paul, is that FERC 1000 and that whole process really clouds it and it's not necessary and we will see where that goes. But as I mentioned, as you know, we have got a right of first refusal in Minnesota. We have it in other jurisdictions. We are not an RTO in Colorado. I think there is some real advantages to that.

877,3037,5405,5405,"Yes. Ali, this is Bob. I think that's the right way to think about it. We recognize that in the back years of our plan, we may have structurally under-forecasted some items. And I think we spent a lot of time with the operations in the businesses this year looking at their asset needs and trying to get everything into a single plan to make it simple and easy for the investor to understand. So I think what you are seeing here is the compilation of probably six months worth of good work by the company trying to identify projects in the back part of the plan that maybe might not have gotten identified in previous plans. So I think we have melded base and what we may have historically called upside or unidentified. I do think though and I think Ben was going to comments on upside and I think there are items that aren't embedded in this plan. I think Ben mentioned one which is a continuation of our PPA buyout strategy. We think we have got 10,000, 11,000 megawatts of PPAs that the company procures today from third-party owners and we still think that there is opportunities out there to find customer beneficial acquisitions.

You are right. I think the wind industry will take a little time to adjust quite frankly, Travis, when the PTCs roll-off. Of course, there is a chance they won't.Our approach to the solar piece of this is that I think the cost curve on solar continues to decline pretty quickly. And so we think that even the absence of the roll-off of ITC or most of it anyway will be more than offset by just gains in the solar itself and we think that times of very, very nicely to the retirement of our coal plants in the mid-2020. So we don't see a need to go out and lock anything in because we think the cost curve will more than offset the ITC reduction.

We just so happen to want to focus on solar as we are retiring our coal plants.

It would have been a little bit higher than the revenue number based on other elements of it. So,  $200 million of bookings, that would've been on our radar when we started the year that are not going to be in Q4 this this year and would have been in Q4 last year as a direct apples-to-apples comparison.

But I think if you look at the – M&A absolutely will be a component of how we look to grow the businesses. I think Don's comments really indicate that we have a lot of internal growth opportunities, some organic growth opportunities. By leveraging those with some M&A to make them go quicker and grow them more quickly, I think, is clearly one of our strategies. So, it's not going to be us just going out and acquiring revenue. It's going to be us investing in the business.

And ideally, we'll be able to kind of keep investors in the loop as each of those decisions becomes public, what the impact of those is. Because, as you indicated, you have got an element of AAH is going away. But starting 2020, I've got an element of AbleVets that's coming in. Right now, there's going to be a lot of puts and takes. I can't give you with clarity when those are going to hit. But as we roll – get to the end, we start rolling into the 2020, we should be able to give you a better view of kind of the revenue that is in the bucket that we think is likely something that we're going to adjust out relative to portfolio management and the other things that we would expect to be able to bring in as we roll forward. The point that you're getting to is really important is that 2020 will reset the base, our revenue number. And it's going to be at the – taking out low-margin revenue and bringing in big opportunities for growth and higher margin revenue.

I think we had a good contribution from the federal business as is kind of expected given the end of the government fiscal year. So, I think that was a contribution. But given the percent of that business versus the total business,  that was the upside to our bookings. We had some other things that came into the larger number than we originally expected.

But I think as we continue to move and more toward these SaaS business models, toward the monthly payments, you start getting into a mode of where those checks will be more repetitive in nature, similar to our support checks that we get as we go through this business. Obviously, in our mind, as we move to those platforms, it is going to help our conversion, lower our DSO, lower the AR as we move forward. We are very happy with the free cash flow that we delivered this quarter. Very strong and want to replicate that again in Q4 to get us to a fairly good position for 2019. And then, just as a reminder, from overall free cash flow, we'll complete the work on our new campus in the first half of 2020, which will then start allowance for the loss, a lot of the expenditures that are being spent on that campus, adding potentially $100 million of free cash flow as we roll forward past that completion.",AID_7,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

973,3039,10218,10218,"Clearly, 80% of our clients are hosted today. First, AWS, there's a kind of strategy of when we're moving things there. HealtheIntent is going to be the first platform when we move there. It's a cloud developed solution that we host today. Very natural to move that over to AWS. And that's the first thing you're going to see move, and we'll have that primarily moved in the first half of next year. The benefits of doing that are lower cost of operation from using a platform that I can buy on an as-needed basis, hour by hour as opposed to building out the maximum capacity I need at the height and having to provision for that in my data center. It also allows me to take those data center components and space and rededicate them to projects such as the DoD and the VA, which is significant savings of capital as we roll forward. So, relative to the hosting versus AWS, at a tactical level, it will drive efficiencies and drive up cost optimization as we move forward. We'll continue to move the platforms. CareAware will be the next platform we move over to AWS. And then, obviously, over time, then we start moving elements and components of Millennium over to that platform. But the first mover is going to be HealtheIntent, perfectly designed to go do that. We already have HealtheIntent running in AWS.

We think it's got interesting trend around it, particularly with large regional IDMs who are building out network strategies within their MSA. So, it's a space we like a lot and areas like behavioral health continue to be huge growth areas for us within the strategic growth business. I think secondly, from a Home Health perspective, you'll recall that we acquired a solution in that space called BeyondNow. So, we we had an acquired solution in that area and we stepped back and looked at it and said, is this an area where we want to make significant investment? Or alternatively, is there a chance for us to partner? We like the Brightree solution offering. It's cloud-based. We think it's industry-leading. It has a very accelerated implementation timeline around it. And as I started the conversation with ResMed, we saw an opportunity for HealtheIntent to be a material network overlay around our postacute assets. And we also thought they brought some interesting sort of non-traditional assets from our perspective around areas like sleep and respiratory that could be very interesting for us as we play through our strategy on a five-year basis and start thinking about member and consumer strategies where that ends up being relevant around premium and first dollar risk strategies. So, that's how we thought about it at the decision tree level, if you will.

We're not going to be spending more money on buildings. That's clear. So, the cash flow, it's safe.

We're starting to see those clients actually complete their contracts with Cerner and move on to a different platform. And that's offsetting the growth that you would see in the support stream normally. Once those kind of get fully embedded, which probably should be over the next 12 months or so, I think you're going to see going back to kind of low-single digit increases.

What I would tell you is that the Mexico opportunity seemed to come about more quickly than other areas of North America. And as we moved into Mexico, we really were looking for acquisition candidates that check several boxes that we needed to have checked. And some of those include they need to have a solid store base. They need to have a leadership team that was grounded and understood the marketplace very well. They needed to be a good culture fit for our company. And they needed to have scalable systems. And while we looked at some companies along the way that were larger than the Mayasa organization, the Mayasa organization seemed to check all of those boxes, so very solid leadership team.

Now what I would tell you is we haven’t closed on the deal yet and there is much work to be done, which, as Jeff said, was one of the reasons that we reduced our store count outlook for 2020, is because of the level of effort that goes into preparing for growth in Mexico. And again, the Mayasa organization gives us the ability to do that. They’ve got distribution. They’ve got the knowledge of the marketplace.

But when you look at it from an application-to-application standpoint, we are consistently very competitive from a price point standpoint. That consumer is buying products online. For price, we’ll be able to go out and look for a part for his vehicle that maybe we have on a proprietary brand at equal to or sometimes less than what the pure online retailers are selling at.",AID_18,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1000,3040,37417,37418," So when we look at our business, I think we’ve been pretty clear that the professional side of the business where the average consumer or end consumer is less price sensitive, continues to see good unit growth and average ticket growth, and that’s why that side of the business continues to lead. On the DIY side of the business, we have pressure on our ticket count from rising prices so that is limiting what the comp is on that side. So we still feel very good about a 5% comp in the third quarter. When we look at annualizing these price increases, I think our direction is similar to where we’ve see shocks in gas prices. We would expect that the DIY side will – the average consumer will become adjusted to what the current prices are and that we will see, as we annualize these increases, less pressure on count.",AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

If the tariffs and inflation persist, we feel like the more cash-strapped consumer will have to make some decisions, not much different than what we would face with rising fuel prices and ordinary inflation. And while we haven’t seen a lot of evidence of deferred maintenance, it would be somewhat likely that, that would be a decision that, that consumer might make if they were having financial difficulties to defer – not, not complete those maintenance cycles but defer those and extend those maintenance cycles out a little bit longer.

And if you look in the past, your business seemed to have averaged something a little bit higher than that with no inflation, 2% to 3% or even better than that with no inflation.

So for 10, we feel really good.Second, when we put the design rules in for 7-nanometer, we were less aggressive in terms of density. Our learning from going from 14 to 10 is with a benefit of hindsight, we were just -- we tried to scale at a 2.7 factor and that was -- that ended up putting too much invention or revolutionary nodes into the fab environment to meet those kind of hurdles and the learning from that is, we just can't hit those kind of really aggressive targets, when, to your point, the dynamics are getting increasingly challenging. So lots of learnings out of 10. Our transition to 10 that we incorporated into 7, the design the design rules there's less complexity and for the last couple of years that we've been working with EUV.Litho has been the challenge. We've had EUV that we've been working with for a few years now and we expect to use EUV as we scale 7. And we indicated that our first product will be two years from this quarter. So fourth quarter of 2021, our first 7-nanometer product will come out and our expectation is that we'll get back on a two-year cadence from 7 and beyond.

Over the course of the last three years, I guess, we've grown the business by about 20%, so $13 billion in revenue over the last three years, and the practical reality is we didn't anticipate that kind of explosive growth three years ago, so we didn't have the capacity in place to deal with it, and we've been working our tails off for the last 12 months to ensure for our customers that we wouldn't be a constraint on their growth.From the last two years, I think, as you know, we've spent over $30 billion in CapEx to both, have more capacity for 14, while we also begin to ramp 10. In my prepared comments I said, we added 25% wafer start capacity 2018 to 2019.Our first half to second half unit volume will be up double-digits. So we're making good progress throughout the course of the year, but our expectations were in the second half, we would be back in a supply/demand equilibrium. And the fact of the matter is we're not there, because the demand profile that's resulted in our $1.5 billion higher revenue is just higher than we had anticipated. So we have more work to do to meet our customers' demands in the fourth quarter and going into 2020.As we see fourth quarter, we're still going to be a constraint in our customers' growth, which is absolutely where we do not want to be. But with the higher demand, we will be constraining their growth in the fourth quarter.But as we go into 2020, our expectations are, we'll add another 25% capacity both for 14 and 10 and that we will have particularly for PC client we expect to be able to do a mid-to-high single-digit unit volume growth next year and that we don't expect the market to grow that fast. But we got to have just more inventory buffers, so we're there when our customers need it. So Q4 will be a little challenging and 2020, we expect to be able to rectify things.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

And we expect those to continue, but to your point, the -- our experience with the cloud providers as they go through big buying cycles and then relatively long digestion periods.What we did experience last year was a gang -- gang-buster year. But it's been three quarters coming into the third quarter, where they went through digestions. And what we started to see in the third quarter was particularly for high performance compute started to see them come back into the market to really begin to -- begin to purchase a little bit more.So how long that cycle lasts is going to be a function of several variables. But yes their end demand seems to continue to be relatively strong. And therefore, they need to add capacity.

The strength was much higher than we anticipated back in July. We had a first half to second half acceleration, but the acceleration was just more than we expected. And I would say we saw strength across the Board.But as we look at the EMG growth in particular, we're trying to determine what is kind of -- what has a tendency if they pull in versus what can we count on as we project things forward.

Today, as we look into 2020. You have a lot of moving parts with two nodes ramping 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer yields competition lots of moving parts admittedly.

1057,3041,37382,37382,"I would probably just, I guess echo. In all the complexity and all the moving parts – George kind of flagged the – where I'd characterize the four things that we're really dialing in on. One, going into next year mix is going to be better as our modem volume will be lower and our NSG profitability will be better. So, mix is going to have a – mix has been a drag on 2019's gross margin, and it will be a big contributor as we go into 2020.And secondly, on the first half of 2019, we had a lot of the – on cost of sales related to pre-PRQ 10-nanometer products. So that will not repeat itself. So those two things are good favorable things.The third thing is just George flagged this I just simplified. There's no transition and for us no transition next year is going to be 14-nanometer, we'll be a little better in terms of its profitability. Yields won't be dramatically different because we're extremely mature. But depreciation levels will be lower, because a lot of these tools have been fully depreciated, there because we've been on that node for so long. So, for the node transition 14 will be a little bit better.Our expectation is 10-nanometer yields will continue to improve, but at the same time the mix of 10 versus 14 will be a little bit of a wait. So, no transition will work against us. And we also - we've tried the best we can take into account competitive dynamics as we exit this year and going into next year in our quest to play a bigger role in our customers' success. We're going to compete to protect our position and expand the role we play.

The average age of our existing boxes meaning they can be replaced one for one, as opposed to new boxes being purchased to replace old boxes.It's just -- you know the amount of churn inside the business. If you think about churn coming down that also takes down your capital significantly.

1091,3042,29660,29660,"Then you asked about rate, and so maybe some thoughts. Our third quarter, I think you mentioned fourth quarter, so just to clarify, third quarter residential ARPU does not reflect any of the recent rate increases that we have implemented. Those are beginning really at the start – after the start of Q4, so it won't be a full fourth quarter. And they're being applied in video which reflects higher input of programming cost and some non-promotional rates on Internet. So if you take a look, I know there were some questions around it. You look at our Q3 result results it shows -- we believe we have a long runway for Internet and customer relationship growth. So there shouldn't be too much of a read through that.We've always believed that creating more customer relationships is the most valuable way to grow long-term cash flow. And through the integration we'd been careful about driving additional billing calls or service transactions from rate increases. And then, I guess another read through as well, manage the profitability of our overall customer relationship when we're using video to enhance it, but that being said, they were rate increases not that materially difference than what we'd had in the past.We have a lot of customers in year one and year two promotional rates that aren't subject to some of the increases. And for video, we increasingly have a higher mix of customers in wider packages without boxes which won't have the same increases. So our goal is to maintain our competitiveness across all products and their preference or strategy, optimism for growing by volume is opposed to just by rate that remains unchanged. You asked about in the fourth quarter impacts similar to past increases and because it's not that material, some might have feared or hope, and we don't anticipate any meaningful negative impact on the fourth quarter net additions as result of the rate increase.But I would highlight to you and others just keep in mind, the fourth quarter last year was a pretty good quarter for charter and we expect the back half of this year inclusive of Q3 and Q4 so that things we've said in the past to be better as it relates to Internet and customer relationships. That doesn't mean that we don't expect a good fourth quarter and this year as well.

But the bigger piece is that we've had a subscriber decline of Resi and SMB of 2.3%. There's been a mixed shift as it relates to Stream and Choice products, which just have less channels inside of them. And then on top of that the pay-per-view environment particularly the past two quarters has not been particularly good on the revenue side, which means that your costs are going down year-over-year for pay-per-view and all of that is packing into a current 0.4% year-over-year growth in programming.But your actual unit cost has expanded cost per customer relationship. It's kind of been what it's been for many years in the mid single digit range. And we've had some pretty big renewals as publicly announced tied to some of the security and password sharing collective efforts, so you know which those are. So there will be some step-up associated with that. But I think as you look out through next year there's nothing we see today that causes there to be a dramatic change from where the overall marketplace has been for the type of rate increases that we expect to see on that product. And as we've talked about before, historically we've not passed all that through to and to our customers and we're evaluating our ability to continue to do that even as we use the video product to drive connectivity services. And we've just spoken about some of that as it relates to the most recent rate increases.So, I don't expect any big dramatic changes other than growth is a big factor, mix is a big factor, the pay-per-view market has been under some challenge past two quarters which is lower than programming expense, it's unclear how much that'll continue.

We've virtualized our entire call center and the field operations service infrastructure, but we still have visibility obviously into the Legacy Charter franchise areas and DMAs. And so what you can see is that Legacy Charter metrics, operating metrics whether it's calls for customer, billing calls for customer, retention calls for customer, truckloads for customer, all remained significantly below Legacy, TWC and Bright House despite Legacy, TWC and Bright House having significant improvements. Part of that is because of the previous investments in the Legacy Charter, Infrastructure, a part of that is Legacy Charter has continued to get better and better every year and quarter-over-quarter continues to make pretty significant improvements.So it’s a moving target, which just means that when you make that upfront investment in service, it’s a virtuous cycle of continuing to get better and better and while we don't report or track the P&L of Legacy Charter because the service is virtualized, if it had one at our cost to serve there would have been continuing throughout the cycle.

We're obviously experimenting with convergence and we've done a bunch of radio and mobile experiments this year testing, switching dual SIM technology. We've also continue to work on the DOCSIS 4.0 strategy.We talk to with gaming companies about putting compute power deeper in the network. When you look at real estate footprint we have lots of hubs throughout our architecture that have space in them as a result of the compression of electronic through time. And as a result of that we are able to stand up high compute, low latency networks that are hard to replicate. And we think that there is a product development cycle that'll occur there and give us an upside opportunity. But the fundamental position we're in at the moment is we still have lots of headroom from the last investment cycle we made, which was quite efficient.We also have been launching as I mentioned the product of in-home Wi-Fi management which allows customers to manage their privacy, their security and to know what is connected in their house and what its connected to and to be able to manage that in an efficient way to not only privacy but for parental control and quality of the network itself throughout the home.

And so, streaming products have been sold with five streams and with no location based kind of security. Most households in the United States have two or less people in them. And as a result of that, there are more streams than there are households available for free.And by sharing passwords and by not having location based or subscriber based relationships with those streams, and the fact that TV everywhere allows for massive numbers of streams replicated through virtual MVPDs and so forth. There are -- it's just too easy to get the product without paying for it.

1101,3042,26457,26457,"So, Ben, I think if we look over the next couple of years the best place is start with the last couple of years. And we did the DOCSIS 3.1 rollout over two-year period which took our capability from a couple of 100 megabits per customer up to one gig per customer everywhere we operate. And there's still more upside out of that infrastructure deployment that we made with DOCSIS 3.1 in terms of both speed and things that we can offer from a product perspective, but one of the great thing that's coming out of that, that we didn't really talk about as we did was our ability to manage traffic in the network and therefore reduce network investment associated with increased consumption. And we've had a regular budget item associated with network consumption in our capital planning and related to the growth in overall average consumption of data per customer and 3.1 has allowed us to manage that less capital intensive way.So you have that project. And if you look at it, it was taking a massive speed increase on a legacy infrastructure at a capital cost of about $9 for home passed, a fairly small investment for home passed with a massive output. And that's the fundamental notion behind our 10 gig strategy, DOCSIS 4.0 strategy, which allows multiple pathways for development depending on how deep you want to take fiber or whether you want to improve your bandwidth in your legacy coaxial network.

We are making progress and that’s going to be the probably the biggest fuel on the fire in terms of the growth rate accelerating in NIPT.In terms of – I’ll jump to genetic disease and then I’ll get to oncology. In genetic disease, we’ve made very good progress in terms of reimbursement. So in the U.S., there are over a 150 million covered lives now that have access to - or whole exome and whole genome sequencing in the event that the child has a genetic disease.The bottleneck there is not reimbursement. The bottleneck there is utilization and so, although there are 250,000 children here in the U.S. that have the indication the condition and have reimbursement in place, if we look back over the last 12 months, just over a 1000 tests ordered. And so in the genetic disease market and the biggest near-term opportunity there is in the U.S., the big driver is going to be around the utilization.And educating the physicians around when to order the test making sure that they are able to interpret the results when they get the test. And so, that’s work that we are doing through our medical affairs, clinical affairs teams and through great partners and customers like Rady's Children's Hospital in San Diego that’s sort of driving a lot of the awareness around genetic disease.In oncology, we are seeing very strong growth. We are seeing already, we are seeing reimbursements continue to build. We are seeing panels proliferates and so, there, there are number of things that will drive the further acceleration of that growth rate. One is the availability of an IVD product that now makes these tests accessible to community hospitals.All of the action happening in oncology, even though we are seeing big growth there, it’s driven in the academic cancer centers. So the sophisticated labs. And so, an availability of an IVD actually will catalyze further acceleration of that market.And then, the continued development of precision oncology therapy as more therapies emerge in the market, it really pulls the need for NGS testing for patients to get access to those therapies.

And that played out again a few years later as you touched on with DX.And so, when I just talked about the desktop side of the portfolio and customers are migrating up to a bigger instrument, so they were moving to the NextSeq DX for example from MiSeq, that’s the exact same phenomenon.Right, so, what we’ve learned from our customers is that, when they buy a bigger box, it’s an expectation that they have – that they will have more business and that’s typically how it plays out. And it doesn’t play out in the quarter that they buy a box. In some cases, for example, a couple of quarters in the case of that, the HiSeq.And so, so that’s the elasticity fact we are seeing. Separately, you talked about the drivers of that we expect to see going forward in the business and some of the drivers include things like, as you touched on the population sequencing efforts for example, that are starting to ramp up. So for example, UK Biobank ramped up at the tail end of Q3.That’s going to play out not just in Q4. But all through 2020. We talked about All of Us that's going to start in the beginning of 2020. So really wasn’t a factor in 2019 at all, but it’s going to play out over 2020. Similarly the NHS, it wasn’t a factor at all and in fact this year we were caught in the gap between Gel winding down.And so, less revenue this year from Gel than we had last year and the NHS not yet ramping up.

So we are seeing at the top end of the MiSeq customer base, some customers are opting to buy NextSeq and at the top end in terms of usage, on the NextSeq customer base, we are seeing some customers move up to NovaSeq.So, these transitions from their existing platforms to larger platforms are good signs for us but in the near term do put some downward pressure on the pull through as they ramp up utilization on their bigger systems. General customers tend to buy bigger systems, because they have expectations that their usage is going to go up over time.The second trend that we are seeing play out is as you touched on the NextSeq DX and what we are seeing in actually both the MiSeq portfolio and the NextSeq portfolio is that we are seeing customers start to purchase the NextSeq DX.

1148,3043,37123,37123,"Yes, so, we started to call that out in Q2 on the call. And now we have additional quarter of data. And so, what we are seeing is two transitions playing out. One transition playing out is we are seeing customers migrate up to bigger systems and that played out at the top-end of MiSeq customers that moved to the NovaSeq platform and similarly, we had some high volume NextSeq customers that started to purchase NovaSeq. And so, one trend playing out as customers moving up to bigger system and as I said before, we’ve seen this play out the full whereas customers typically move to bigger systems, because they expect to do more sequencing. And so, while that puts some near-term pressure on pull-through for instruments over time to increase sample volume and growing business, we expect their consumable spend to grow and sort of take the pressure of the pull-through per incident.The second trend that we are seeing is, people embracing the NextSeq DX that we brought to the market. And so, we saw customers both on the MiSeq base as well as the NextSeq base that are starting to purchase NextSeq DXs. Now, as the clinical box takes a little time for them to validate those boxes and ramp them up, and so that drove the pull-through, the NextSeq pull-through per instrument down in the quarter. Again, we believe long-term, that’s a really positive trend for our business and NextSeq DX as a percentage of total shipments move from 10% last year in 2018 to 20% in 2019. So really good progress from a clinical perspective. In the near-term, those new DX boxes put pressure on pull-through per NextSeq until they ramp up. But again, it’s a good sign for long-term growth.Sam Samad: Maybe the only thing I would add to everything Francis said is that, in terms of the timeframe as to when we expect this to continue happening for, Q4 reflects the assumption that both NextSeq would be at the low end of the pull-through range and MiSeq would be below the pull-through range.

1153,3043,19950,19950,"That’s a really great question, Steve. And we do – as you can imagine, monitor the activity in BaseSpace very closely to get insights into what our customers are doing. I’ll pull out some things that we look at and some of the data we’ve uncovered so far. One of the things we look at pretty closely is what happens with customers that transition to a NovaSeq.And so, we look at it from a High-Throughput-to-High-Throughput conversion. So what happens to high peak or ex customers who they know as NovaSeq and we look at from NextSeq to NovaSeq perspective to say okay, when a customer, who is a NextSeq customer primarily adds a NovaSeq, you see a drop overall in their consumable spend, because they are able to leverage the lower cost per view or not.And what we are finding in both of those scenarios is that you actually see an expansion in their consumable spend, right? That customers will add and NovaSeq – or will upgrade to a NovaSeq because they believe that they are having growth in their business. And so – I will give you some anecdotal color.So for example, we had a customer that was primarily in the NIPT business. That was primarily a NextSeq customer. And really look to add their incremental NovaSeq purchase as the way they get into some of the more sequencing-intensive oncology segments for example. And so, NovaSeq helps to put together the business case for their entry into the oncology space.And so that’s an example of a customer that had its business continuing to sequence for NIPT primarily on a NextSeq, but is expanding its business based on the economics it can get on NovaSeq. We also look at the kinds of applications that are driving the NovaSeq utilization. So we look hard at – we expect customers to be doing genomes and first question they are and the volume of data on NovaSeq is very high. Last quarter we now crossed over where NovaSeq as a platform is generating more data than any other platform we had. It’s our path to HiSeq X. We expect that genomes, we expect that exomes and what we are finding again is those are exactly as we would expect to be biggest applications in NovaSeq.We are not finding cases where customers are using the NovaSeq as sort of a big machine to run other applications more cost-effectively.

Also pleased Michael that we had the Galapagos transaction finalized in the quarter, we're obviously getting going now on a deeper collaboration beyond filgotinib.And as I said to you in the past and I'll say it again, I mean, I think the team here and I have the pipeline as our number one priority of course. And that -- we approach that from a variety of different ways; one is, the strength of our internal pipeline looking for ways to accelerate differentiated medicines that we can internally and with Galapagos now significantly expanding our research base in addition to other collaborations we have externally that allow us to essentially double our research base of medicines coming into the portfolio -- the development portfolio.In terms of therapeutic area, I would say our approach to external partnerships and M&A will be very much the same of what you saw in the past. So first and foremost, it will be driven by science, driven by where we think the most unique opportunities are.Secondarily, will be informed by our own expertise, as you know we play across four therapeutic areas today and strong scientific understanding in the base in antivirals and immuno modulation. And there is no one size fits all of course. I mean, at times it make sense to just do a partnership, but other times it makes sense to do a full acquisition and other times it makes sense to do something like a Galapagos arrangement where we have a deep partnership associated with that.So we'll continue on in that area.

1174,3044,13209,13209,"So, yes, only a few weeks in, right? We got the approval early October. But even within a few weeks we're off to a strong start. I think, the team is very excited about it, but more importantly the early feedback from physicians is very positive and we're hearing a lot of enthusiasm from our prescribers.I do want to explain that the PrEP market is a little bit different than the treatment market and that is that it's much larger in the number of prescribers. So there's over 50,000 prescribers that have actually written at least one script of PrEP with Truvada.So having said that, more than half of the volume that we're seeing in PrEP is actually very concentrated in a couple of thousand specialists who also prescribe in treatment. So that has been our number one focus and target physicians that we have been calling on over the last couple of weeks, because these are folks that obviously largest volume pool, but also folks that have experienced converting from TDF to TAF and also understand the value of DESCOVY and its clinical profile, specifically around the safety with bone and renal.So we assume a very similar conversion than what we've seen in the past. We have a lot of experience here of TDF to TAF conversions and we assume that same conversion rate will happen with these top prescribers. For the balance of the volume, obviously we are assuming a little bit of a slower uptake with those prescribers just because it's so much more diffuse. But having said that, we've augmented the field team.I think Dan mentioned this earlier, how we've taken a lot of our field forces from the cardiopulmonary in light of the generics hitting there. We basically train them and move them over there to supplement the team and also augmented our consumer approach to get really rapid awareness of DESCOVY both to physicians as well as targeted consumers. So so far so good, very excited about the launch and probably in the next quarter we'll have more to talk about with data.",AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

And, obviously, it won't be too long before we start to talk about the guidance for 2020 and beyond and I'm not going to talk about that today.But the bottom-line is we're -- if I take a big step back and think about my confidence in the long-term growth potential of Gilead, it is captured within the strength of the HIV business. I mean that same business that you see offsetting some of the patent expiry this year continues to be we think a very durable business for the foreseeable future. You have a more predictable HIV-HCV business at this time. And then we have upside potential in filgotinib launching next year and I won't repeat, but the Yescarta programs and success accordingly.Having said that, we understand that we want to find ways to continue to look to increase and accelerate our growth in the coming years. And that will happen both through internal strategies associated with the launch products and programs I mentioned and then also outside partnerships and M&A. So rest assured, that we are looking at everything that could help complement our later-stage portfolio out there.And yes, and as you've seen, I think, our behaviors we will be disciplined about that. We will make sure that it's something that we feel scientifically is very strong something that we can add something to and provide strength to. And when and if those opportunities come up we first question have the financial capacity and ability to act. So that's paramount on our mind. We are in it for short, medium, long-term and we're looking to improve all three of those time periods. But clearly the portfolio is absolutely key for me and a key for the leadership team.

So I have really admired Gilead's efficiency as Robin mentioned and the careful management of expenses. And I think that's something that we will continue to make sure that we have the size here as well. I've also been a student of the history here at Gilead and I've looked back in the past and seen in times of important launches that investment has increased correspondingly in the interest of patients, in the interest of shareholders. And I think that type of philosophy I think will continue.And first question we will also be -- as we have generic erosion, of course, coming now this year and next year, we also have the ability to redeploy those resources as we already have done with cardiopulmonary to other areas of focus and interest including the upcoming -- or the current launch for DESCOVY in PrEP. And then we will also make sure that we have a competitive launch of filgotinib because we know that it will be essential to have the right share of voice to get that off to a good start.We have one chance to launch a product in this industry and therefore we have to make that accordingly. So as we get into providing you with more guidance in 2020, we can elaborate a little bit further about how we see that expense management for next year.

So those of you that don't know, I mean that's a combination trial that will allow us to look at the results of a variety of different combinations on the progression of NASH.But as you also know I mean, we've had a number of other collaborations, we've looked at with Novo Nordisk on GLP-1 and some of the other ones that you've already mentioned there Alethia that are approaching this from different angles as well. So I do think though that most progressed clinical trial is currently the ATLAS trial. And once we can see the results for that and dig into that then I think it will help us really understand how to progress ahead with NASH in what format and what way.I would just mentioned that as we've always mentioned, we think that NASH is a very high unmet medical need, but also a challenging disease to develop in given the nature of the disease, given the heterogeneity of the disease, given the end points. And yet, we think a company like Gilead with expertise in this area need to be informed by the science and solve the science to see what our path forward will be.

And so we've really pulled together a team that has considerable experience in this field.The piece that you would say that the differentiated label, I think it's twofold. I think from a label standpoint what we've seen thus far from the FDA is a little bit of a more of a class labeling. And so our expectations and we'll go through the process, but we're also being conservative in our expectations.One of the things that I would say is the importance of our data. And I think that if you look at the results of the three FINCH 3 studies in three different patient groups those are really exciting for us, both from an efficacy standpoint as well as safety standpoint.So, a lot of the work that's being done right now is sub-analysis to ensure that we can better educate physicians about our data. So, that's kind of the plan there. And I do think that the opportunity here is to potentially have a best-in-class drug inhibitor and that could be also related to the sale activity of the JAK1.So, having said that, that's what we're doing.

And GS-6207 is the first-in-class compound. It's got a novel mechanism of action. It's got an orthogonal resistance profile. We haven't seen any pre-existing resistance among all of the samples we've tested from treatment-naïve patients and heavily treatment-experienced patients.These data have been published at recent conferences. And so because of this novel mechanism of action, because of the potency, because of the lack of pre-existing resistance, we really feel that the capsid inhibitor is the really best and lead compound to bring forward in highly treatment-experienced patients.And in fact its promised was recognized by FDA when they granted us breakthrough designation for this population.

But, A, we're constantly prioritizing our portfolio internally. And that is based upon making sure that we have the most-attractive programs that we're funding.Every organization has to draw a line and I think we also have to do that as well. And of course, things change, because of the nature of data that's read out, competitive environments, variety of things that happen. So the portfolio is constantly kind of evolving and moving internally based on that portfolio.And therefore, to your point, there are times when we stop studies, studies come to a natural conclusion and they've been successful and we have those to then reinvest again accordingly. Many of the structures that we've looked at in our partnerships have also been designed to be, first of all, innovation forward but also allow for some balanced risk across the portfolio and spend.For instance, with Galapagos. Our relationship with them is that they are covering trials up until Phase 2 and they take the decisions and they take the risk associated with that and all the diversity and benefit that comes from having another organization look at that differently.And then, post our opt-in of course then we would start to incur expenses on our R&D line as well.

1194,3044,32335,32336," And – yeah, again I would probably start with the investments that you mentioned. I mean I think, it's really important that we acknowledge the fact that the ability to manufacture and the turnaround time associated with cell therapy is absolutely fundamental to patient benefits and also to the efficacy results that we see. And I think it's a real competitive advantage to be able to have a network of manufacturing facilities that are state-of-the-art and are able to reduce that turnaround time including as you mentioned we have made a decision to establish a viral vector facility in one of our current manufacturing sites in Oceanside California that will allow us to not only supports the current products but also future products in the pipeline.So look I mentioned some of the near-term things on CAR T in addition to what we currently have out there with the Yescarta profile today. The state on the Yescarta at ASH I think will be important looking at the three-year data and the early steroid use. The Kite X19 is now a second product for MCL and we look forward to presenting that data as well.ZUMA-7 goes back to a Yescarta in an earlier line sitting. So when you think about the long duration of effect, the efficacy and durability that we've seen in the relapse/refractory third line setting, I mean the real question is and more natural obviously oncology developments avenue is to say, can you bring that affect up into earlier lines of therapy and potentially have this effect with more patients and potentially for longer duration, because you're treating them earlier.So the strategy is very much to continue to expand out the hematology indications first and foremost.

And that combination will lead to new platforms in the future we've spoken about as we look to not just provide a digital care, but also digital care in the community.So, again, its early days, but we are very excited about this idea of doctor-led and pharmacist-enabled including that partnership going forward in that model, yes.",AID_8,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

There's probably some element of a share of the total business that the supplier does in that case the partner does in that case.And then arguably the most important one is the foot traffic benefit where we have quite sophisticated models in the case of existing types of businesses. So, we know if there's a primary care. That's why we're testing these pilots. We're trying to see the uplifts on both retail and on scripts. So, you've got three sources of income in most cases.And when we say there isn't a contribution the FedEx agreement delivers favorable contribution already and we're already at full capacity basically. Already LabCorp on an income basis is positive. What's negative is we're investing capital every time we touch the store. So, it's more a cash flow negative.

And we have done a lot of tests because when you change something in the company and you roll over your new ideas to the stores, you have to invest a huge amount of capital. And so you have to be sure, that you are doing the right things. And this is why, we are doing so many tests and this is why, we are working behind the scenes to prepare our future in something that could give us the right return in a reliable way.So, we are not worried to see that everybody's going into this direction because this is what we saw two years ago, maybe more, three years ago.

1235,3045,720,720,"Yes. So that's a good question. So the -- we did call out the operating performance once you take out the headwind coming from the prior year bonus of around 5%. And within that as well, we're also covering 2 percentage point of growth investments, so you're getting closer to a 7%. And then we've removed e-cigarettes, so you could -- actually if you strip out -- these are all the puts and takes, we've laid out on slide 19.So the way I think you should think about this is, we expect relative stability in the wholesale business. So you've seen the very strong performance in the current year. And I'd be calling on a -- something mid-single-digit revenue growth. And then I think as you look at the RPI segment, you'd be looking at probably flat to declining revenue until we see flat line of sight to improve market circumstances in the U.K. And that's the only question mark we have on the segment.And then in the U.S., I think this year the way you should rationalize the U.S. is, this year we had a contribution coming from Rite Aid. If you kind of remove the contribution, I think we're looking forward to pretty strong script growth is our outlook.And then secondly, we see continued recovery in the retail business. So, we had a very strong exit on retail compared with the first half. The same in pharmacy, we saw a strong recovery on scripts second half, first half. We expect to see a continuation of the improved trend. So that would lead to a low single digit revenue in the U.S. business. So I think, if you look at the total company, I think we're looking at something in the low single digit revenue growth maybe 2%, maybe 3%. So take out Rite Aid, this year and you get pretty close to the same kind of number. ",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

1239,3045,7793,7793,"Morning. Yeah, I think with regarding prescription growth we see a return to normal market in Med D driven by the fact that we got preferred relationships with some of the bigger plans. And we may have lost some of the small preferred access, but they are very small numbers otherwise. So, overall, we feel pretty good about that. You saw an announcement with Centene, where we intend to be more proactive in the Medicaid space going forward as well. There's still areas that we're working on. First of all, we are able to retain more customers. For example, I mentioned Save a Trip Refill in our prepared remarks. That's driving better retention adherence.And last not least, of course, we are able to consolidate pharmacies, not just Rite Aid but the marketplace is changing. We're seeing more pharmacies than normal on the marketplace. And we have a good pipeline of pharmacies that we'll be able to secure in the future and consolidate as the number of pharmacies in the U.S. for the first time for a long time seem to be in decline.

So it would actually be lower than that if you include all the changes and new molecules that comes in.And we've planned relatively consistent with that, but I think realistically I think generic deflation over the next three years is probably a single digit kind of number with some years going up a high single digit. I don't think we'll turn back to double-digit kind of numbers.So we've adjusted.

With the Shields one, it's an early stage investment. We're a minority shareholder and we're developing the local community model and specialty.

Our point on the scripts is, if you take the second half versus first half the scripts are now running at second half 4%. And we had as you know a very weak first half. We were up 1.9%. And that's because we were lapping these call it network changes, where we lost two points in the previous 12 months.And then as you look at the investment profile, I guess that's the upside scenario. We are quite conservative. We build in the cost of executing the initiatives. We do have working capital benefits built in our internal plans. They're quite sizable, so we do expect returns this current year on cash flow.On the pilots themselves, we're not counting on significant flows of income in 2020.

I've always been of the view that we can have roundabout 10,000 pharmacies probably more than we have today, although at different formats. So the format that we have today is really you see that a suburban drug store or the urban store that we have in the big cities, we're developing a small store pharmacy. We got about I think 30 or 40 now actively in the ground. And we're pleased with the results, lower cost more focus on pharmacy and OTC health care and obviously pick up as well. So we're developing that format. So we still got opportunities to fill in some networks.And going forward -- and I think also remember there are 65,000 pharmacies, thereabouts, in the U.S. today and they're coming down in number. So we believe that our efficient supply chain, the strength of our brand and the quality of our pharmacists and the support they're getting through the new IT infrastructures and digital capabilities we're investing in that we will be able to improve not just the efficiency of the pharmacy, but the quality of the care that we provide to patients and payers going forward and have more percent of the pharmacies in the U.S. over time.",AID_21,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1253,3045,25361,25361,"I think if you think about it though the first place you go to is the storage in the stores. So these stories were built in a time when a lot of inventory was in the physical location. If you plot out three years from now there'll be no inventory in the stores in the back-office. So that freed up a couple 1,000, 2,000 square feet per stores. So if you think about it the first piece of the development was free because we've downsized the back-office and the storage space. So the impact on our revenue throughput was minimal.And as we go through each of the partnerships because we're getting an uplift there's a lot of science that goes into this. So we'll be losing -- if you shrink the size of your retail footprint how much you are losing versus you're going to get some uplift from the increased traffic, I don't think you're going to see a massive reduction in the space -- sorry in the revenue as a result of this, quite the contrary.So what you end up with is a more efficient box where you're probably dedicating less space to some categories where you weren't making very much money. You've gotten rid of your storage. You got rid of your back-office. And then you've got value-added services who are attracting different customers in there. And ideally your foot traffic has gone up as a result of that and a more efficient sales per square foot.So I don't think you'll see the revenue. I think Alex is right. I think you'll see the revenue find consistent with what we have potentially improving. And then you see a big change in the rent. And bear in mind that we're quite over rented, so it's a long-term opportunity for the company versus our competitors, we probably years ago entered into lease contracts that were in the best locations, the nicest places and probably overpaid a bit.So as you look forward over a multiyear horizon, we would expect consistent quite material reductions in the cost of rent.

So, for example, and I won't say much more than this, if you assume higher generic penetration which typically improves and has been improving over a fairly long period of time and will still improve not by major amounts that will have a deflationary amount on your -- deflationary impact on your revenue.So, we would believe that the scripts would be higher than 2% to 3%. So, there'll be much more leverage in the income statement.

So it's early days, but that's the model there. Really it's a community model.Our work with AllianceRX is really about the central model in the mean, and of course, working very closely with the owners of Prime which are the Blues and particularly the financial contracts. Obviously, we've put together our business with their business just over two years ago. And the business is now performing from an operational point of view very well, but clearly the market is changing and we're looking forward to how we can of course accelerate growth and work even closer with the Blues in that model going forward.",AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Did I hear that correctly? ,QID_16,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
1264,3045,9002,9003," Okay, great. And just as a follow-up I just want to make sure I understand this. So, we think about its operational growth of roughly 5%, James you talked about topline of 2% to 3%. So, we're talking about cost-cutting and leverage of this business including I think -- I just want to make I heard this correctly that reimbursement is higher. And when you think about it the reimbursement cuts are higher than what you saw in the last three years. So, you're conservative on reimbursement. It sounds like Alex that you have a line of sight to where the scripts are coming from, from that perspective 2% to 3% on the topline. Cost-cutting is going to get you to that five percentage range.

1266,3045,20381,20381,Yeah. Hi. Good morning. I'd start it with the direct savings. I think in the past you said that the long-term plan is to save 50% to 60% of reimbursement pressure or to be offset by generic savings. So when you think about that long-term goal where are you at now into 2020?,QID_19,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
1267,3045,11741,11742," And then maybe just follow-up -- or second one. On the pilots, I know it's a little unclear when they're going to swing positive, but I just want to make sure I understand. Is the main concept of the contribution from those the LabCorp, the VillageMD, the stuff with Optum and Humana, is that foot traffic? Is it your percentage of the earnings of those entities themselves? How's the company going to benefit from those ventures?",QID_8,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
1268,3045,3717,3717,"Yeah. It's an interesting question and that's why we won't be providing growth savings on the call, because I have a philosophy on this, which is the only thing that matters is what hits the bottom line. And you know, the circumstances of the company and it's – if you think about – if you save on a gross basis you're going to offset your inflation. And for a company this size, you can work it out. It's probably $250 million. And then, if you're growing your scripts at 3%, 4%, 5% that's another $100 million of incremental costs, because you have an incremental cost impact every time you fill in new scripts.So you can be quite easily – before you start the year, you're facing a $400 million headwind. So that's the first part. How do you offset inflation? And how do you offset the impact of volume growth? The second one as you've seen, we've taken a very strong stance on the investments. And I don't want that message to be lost. We're hitting the previously indicated guidance range with substantially higher investments. And that's what the cost program is helping us deliver. So, we quite hopefully put in the magnitude of the investments, we're actually spending this year. And it somewhat gets back to the age of some of the systems we have in the company, where 40% of that investment we have year-on-year is going on new pharmacy systems in the U.S. and U.K. and the implementation of SAP in the U.S. We will be able to take out an enormous amount of inventory over the next three years, as we implement these systems, enormous. So these systems will pay for themselves.The second – the next call it third is on new digital capabilities. And then, the final piece is every time we do a pilot – and the pilots are starting to scale up. We have 60, plus 70 – 67 just on Kroger. It costs quite a bit of money to reorganize the stores and try these pilots. These are all fully funded. So that's – long answer to your short question was the overhead is to pay for inflation. It's the dramatic step-change in the investment profile of the company to drive sustainable long-term growth. That's the business we're in. We have to drive growth longer term, and then finally as part of the business model, where reimbursement is offset by [generic] [ph] procurement, savings, volume and SG&A and cost discipline.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

You can just go on the web, get up and running, connect the branch office or connect few users very easily with really few minutes, no training. Really simple on-boarding process, which is what people expect from a cloud solution like that, to ease all that process.I think the two big differentiators in what we have – I don't know, by the way, the competitive landscape is that easy or that simple to turn on. It would be very hard to compete with what I've seen with our product. What I definitely can say is two things that differentiate ours, is what is the level of security? We provide much higher level of security, much higher level of threat prevention. And second is the ability to tie-in into the overall enterprise management and enterprise set of rules, really big part of the same enterprise solution. So, we've built our solution to support that, to be part of that, and we're seeing some nice demand of that.I don't have very high expectation from immediate results that we'll see because I think that some of the targets market that we have are the large customers, and they're very well interested, but will take some time to onboard and to shift infrastructure.

1292,3046,5903,5903,"Thank you, Tal. And hello to everyone joining us today. I'm glad to have you all on the call and pleased to provide you with a bit more insight on the third quarter results.As you heard from Tal, we continue to deliver healthy financial results in the third quarter. We're still in the period of change and transformation as we continue to focus on elevating our customers' security environment into the fifth generation of cyber protection.This means that we have taken upon ourselves quite an ambitious goal of preventing the most advanced cyberattacks and providing an integrated cyber solution for all elements of the modern IT infrastructure – networks, data center, endpoint, mobile, cloud and IoT.We continue to expand our cybersecurity solution consolidation efforts with the Infinity architecture.As you can see from the numbers, we had quite a good success with our cloud solution. Yet, we continue to aim for much higher growth rate across our business.We're still in the period of transformation, moving from a traditional products business into more of an annuity model, which aim to drive our sales execution across all of our business areas.We continue to expand our global field management and conduct more field and marketing activities around the world. Naturally, we would like to see high growth rate sooner, but it does take time and we remain focused on making that happen.We place a lot of emphasis on the cloud and we believe we have the most comprehensive architecture to secure cloud environments. As a result, we've nice successes. Cloud business results continue to be healthy. Growth percentage remains quite high.Some recent example of nice wins in the cloud space includes two of the world's largest accounting firms, two of the world's largest consulting firms, one of the world's largest business media firms, two of the world's largest retail franchises, two of the world's largest stock exchanges and the list goes on with many of the world's top companies, including shipping, financial, telcos and government.Our recent success didn't just focus on the cloud. We have won many projects with our advanced threat prevention for network, endpoint and mobile.One example for such a win is a new customer, an energy company in America. We asked them what made them choose Check Point. They quoted few major reasons. One is that only Check Point has real-time threat prevention. The competition simply lacks these capabilities as their threat analysis works in the background and don't stop the attack.The second reason was the superiority of our management. Our interface is more comprehensive and much easier to use. Things that take hours with the competition simply takes minutes with Check Point. Overall, they felt that Check Point has a better architecture with much better TCO.This is quite typical of what we learn from the marketplace. In both the qualitative and quantitative research we conduct, we see three main reasons that customers choose Check Point.First is the real-time threat prevention. Second is the management capabilities. And third is the completeness of our security architecture.Here is a real-world example of a customer experience that just happened this quarter. The potential customer started testing our CloudGuard product. A week after starting trial, they had enough confidence to turn on the real-time prevention mode.They were in the middle of an ITO process and that's where the story turned interesting. Our SandBlast technology, embedded into the CloudGuard product, caught a file that contained some command-and-control malware that could have leaked very confidential information.This malware infected a file which was sent from their account to their banker's account. If that file would have gone through, you can just imagine the potential damage to the customer and the investment bank.Many solutions could have been deployed to handle this incident. By using almost any average solution in the marketplace, the cost of the investigation, forensic, collection and remediation of this incident could have been enormous, between hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars.By using the Check Point product, the file was cleaned by our threat extraction engine alerts were recorded and no damage occurred. The cost of this incident to the customer was zero instead of the hundreds of thousands of dollars or more in real damages.This kind of incident happens many times every day. In most cases, we don't even hear the story simply because the effectiveness of the real-time prevention solution.Unfortunately, our incident response team is seeing an increasing incidence that have significant impact which could have been eliminated if the organization had been using our fifth generation threat prevention solution.Turning the subject to some of the new products we launched in the recent months. We continue to upgrade our security appliance family. In July, we launched the 16000 and 26000 security appliance family.These high-end and data center grade models provide threat prevention performance in the range of 12 Gb to 30 Gb per second. On the other side of the scale, we launched the 1500 series of appliances earlier this month, with a starting price under $1000 and the performance between 456 to 660 megabits of threat prevention performance.This model shows the strength and the scale of our architecture and the ability to provide the most comprehensive security architecture at all price and performance levels.A new addition to our family of products was the CloudGuard Connect and CloudGuard Edge solutions. CloudGuard Connect allows the utilization of the same security architecture through cloud service, connecting branch office directly to the cloud with no on-premise equipment. It opens the door to many new opportunities and is fully integrated into the same policies and management tools used by our customers.One change was also implemented with the newer client models is simplify the subscription process. As we discussed previously with the old models, every appliance included a bundled one-year next-generation that prevention subscription and the customer could choose to upgrade. In addition, the customer had to choose the support level they required. And in the second year, they had to renew both.With the new model, we're simplifying the process. The appliance is provided in a basic configuration and the support and security subscription are bundled into a single offer with three levels.So, the first year and the following year looks the same as there are fewer and simpler choices to make. All customers receive access to 7/24 support service. This new model shifts even more revenue into the annuity part of our business model.It's too early to measure the effect of these business model changes. We will only see the full impact of these changes in the future.Talking about business models makes a nice transition to speak about our projection for the next quarter. You know once regular caveat, it's hard to predict the future. There are many promising deals and results with a lot of unknowns that can impact results.With that said, our revenues for the fourth quarter are expected to be between $527 million to $557 million and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $1.93 to $2.04. GAAP EPS is expected to be approximately $0.19 lower.Thank you. And now, we'll be happy to answer your questions.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

And another one, by the way, that adds a lot of value to the market is what we call the Maestro Orchestrator. The Maestro is actually quite revolutionary, right when we came in earlier in the year, at the beginning of the year. And it's already actually starting to gain share and get into the market in nice volumes.And Maestro basically allows to take several of the appliances and turn them into a super appliance, with much higher performance, with much higher level of redundancy, what we call, cloud-like performance, very high level of flexibility and very high level of resiliency. I think we're really seeing good traction of that.Right now, I'm not seeing a lot of down shift for appliances. I think, by the way, that's also some of the changes that we've made to the appliance subscription model, try to help invest at the basic appliance, may go – may be slightly lower in price with the new appliances, but the subscription somehow compensates for that and give the customers a simpler and easier way to account for it in the annuity side of business.What I also like to comment on that – all the thing I've said so far was on the positive side of the new appliance, and which I think is being received quite well. The only thing that I would say is that we see that, for large projects and large customers, it actually takes a long time to move to a new model. I'd expect when we come up with a new model from – when I'm the consumer, I like to move to the new model the next day. What I'm seeing in the sales cycle to big enterprises that it takes between three months to nine months and sometimes even more to get the new model into the sales cycle. Many times, there's an RSP already with the old model. Many times customer need certification.

So, it's much less – like a consumer service that you get, the secure pipe to a highly secured pipe with your level, with your privacy and your level of management and your policy, much more in what our customers like to see.

1322,3046,33166,33166," The pricing model, you mean what Gil was referring to? First, of course, we checked with customers and partners before. It simplifies significantly for them the universe. I'll give you an example. Before when they purchase an appliance, at that point of time, we gave them the NGTP incorporated. So, they didn't have much of an option to choose if it's NGFW or NGTP. On the other hand, they could upgrade to NGT if they chose to. Then they had to make a decision, what level of support they want. And they have different level of support, it can be the standard, the premium, the diamond, they can choose on-site support, non-on-site support and so on. So, that's many, many options for just buying that appliance.Now, it's much simpler. Basically, they choose appliance. It doesn't integrate in it the subscription. So, it's a cheaper, in a sense, or lower price when you come to the base model. That, like you said, can hurt our product revenues. We understand that. But the benefit is, for the customers and for us, now he has an ability to choose one of three layers, options – NGFW, NGTP or NGTX package, including the support, which is 24/7.

But what we're seeing more and more is that the big challenge is actually in the more advanced threat prevention capabilities and in being flexible and agile to the changes in the threat landscape.And I think there's not a stable environment. It's not an environment when we set the roadmap. That's an environment when the threats in our world are setting the roadmap. And I think, on that front, we've seen a lot of success with the open architecture which we're utilizing. We have the most agile software. I think we demonstrate that, again, customers that test our product in depth see the superiority of security and we hear it from almost every customer that have gone in depth through the analysis.And what we've found, over time, that in order to do that, the right architecture is an open architecture and ASICs that can do a good job in accelerating very simple operation, simply fail when it comes to advanced capability with security needs.

1324,3046,2623,2623,"Great. Thank you, Kip. Good morning and good afternoon to everyone to joining us on the call today. I'm pleased to begin a review of the third quarter.Revenues for the quarter increased by 4% year-over-year to $491 million and our non-GAAP EPS reached $1.44. Our revenues were slightly above the midpoint of our guidance and the non-GAAP EPS was at the top end of our guidance.Before I proceed further into the numbers, let me remind you that our GAAP financial results include stock-based compensation charges, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses as well as the related tax effects.Keep in mind, as applicable, non-GAAP information is presented excluding these items.Now, let's take a look at the financial highlights for the quarter. Revenues for the quarter came $1 million above the midpoint of our guidance. Product and security subscription revenues were $272 million, a 6% increase year-over-year.Our subscription revenues continue to be strong, with 13% growth, reaching $154 million. Our software update and maintenance revenues increased to $219 million, representing 3% growth year-over-year. The growth in our subscription revenues is driven by our advanced solutions, mainly next generation threat extraction and protection, CloudGuard solution and Infinity.Deferred revenues as of September 30, 2019 reached $1.242 billion, a growth of $94 million or 8% year-over-year.Revenue distribution by geography for the quarter was as follows – 46% of revenues came from Americas, 42% of the revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and the remaining 12% came from Asia-Pacific.Since the beginning of 2019, Middle East and Africa are part of Europe, Middle East and Africa region, while before it was part of Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Africa region.The revenue distribution by geography for Q3 last year – for comparison purposes – after the reclassification would have been 47% of revenues came from Americas, 41% of revenues came from Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and the remaining 12% came from Asia-Pacific.We continue to invest in our sales force and marketing in order to execute our growth strategy. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 50%, same as the previous quarter and in line with our plans.Effective non-GAAP tax rate for this quarter was 19%, similar to the last quarter. Please note that, in the fourth quarter, we expect the tax rate to be around zero and the lapse of statute of limitation expected to occur by the year-end. Our expected tax rate for the year remains around 40% as predicted in the beginning of the year.GAAP net income for the quarter was $188 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income was $217 million or $1.44 per diluted share.Our cash balances as of September 30, 2019 was $4.055 billion compared to $4.072 billion last year. Operating cash flow was $244 million. Collection from customers continued to be strong. Our cash payment increased in line with our continued investment in sales and marketing.During the quarter, we utilized nearly the maximum quarterly buyback authorized, and purchased 2.9 million shares for $323 million at an average price of $112.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

As you can see, this quarter, Incyte is growing even faster than the previous one versus last year. And our Q3 last year was a little bit lower maybe than it should have been. So, the ratio of the 25% growth for Jakafi US maybe slightly higher than the true trend. Although the year, I think we are more in the 20%, which is still very, very strong for sort of a seventh, eighth year of commercialization. And we see a lot of potential for continued growth of Jakafi in the US in MF. It is still volume growth. Patient volume is increasing in MF. And in PV, as we said, there is larger potential for two reasons. It's because treatment rate is still on the low end, below 50%, and the duration of treatment for every patient studied on Jakafi is very much longer than what we have in MF. So, what we see is sort of chronicization of the disease in MF that is leading to this growth potential that is obviously higher. We are not changing the long-term guidance very frequently, but we have made a lot of progress throughout the number that we gave a few years ago of 2.5 to 3, and that's something we are very confident in. Regarding the P&L itself and the margin, as Christiana said, we are investing in R&D based on the quality and the required work for the assets that we have. And so, it may be fluctuating, as you have seen. When epacadostat did not work as planned, to say the least, you could see that it has a positive impact on the R&D, which is obviously the paradox of our industry, is that if you stop a project, it will improve margins. But, obviously, our goal is not to manage the margin short-term proactively, but to maximize the value to the company and the shareholders by doing the right clinical development for each of the assets that we have in our hand. At the same time, you may have seen, from 2014 to today, is that we are in the trend of improving ratios in the P&L where the growth of the top line has been not every single quarter, but on – if you look at it on a cumulative fourth quarter in a row, that margin has been improving over time. And that's why we're where we're today, the P&L has the shape that it has to today. So, that's something we will continue to look for, but it may include quarters where investment will increase because some of the assets that we have are requiring an increased investment at some point.

We're going to increase slightly the number of FTEs that we have that are targeting graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant centers and then a few FTEs that will be concentrated on pemigatinib.

Chronic does have a slightly different pathophysiology as it's more a disease of fibrosis with more skin manifestations as opposed to more apoptotic disease in acute where there's more sort of cell death in the liver and GI tract.

There are three pillars to the program and you mentioned all of them. So, firstly, in terms of formulation work, which you brought up, that's been ongoing this year. It involves an extended release approach in terms of formulation and bioavailability and bioequivalence work. That is underway. It's been going well. As you just said, complete in 2020 at some point. And then, we'll use it to have regulatory discussions probably through the middle of 2021. We'll find an appropriate meeting to present that. But I'll remind you that we actually presented some ruxolitinib XR data in 2011 with the 25 milligram XR tablet. So, we have already and that work is ongoing and progressing well. In terms of the second pillar, combinations, we are running, as you said, the PI3-kinase delta combination. That's the most mature of them. We also have a rux plus pim combination and a rux plus itacitinib combination ongoing. We'll have ourselves – data inhouse to look at ourselves with rux plus delta approximately end of this year and we'll find an appropriate meeting to present it at in 2020 and make decisions – go-forward decisions or not in either first or second line on myelofibrosis when we look at the completeness of the data. We'll also – should have enough data with pim and itacitinib also to present in 2020 at an appropriate meeting. And then, the third pillar, and very important, is new targets to look at in MF and PV in collaborations with academia and different vendors, including epigenetic screen, to look if there are any new targets there and we haven't announced anything publicly yet.

For REACH2, they include things like anti-thymocyte globulin, extracorporeal photopheresis, there is mesenchymal stromal cells, low-dose methotrexate, mycophenolate and even EMTO inhibitors like Everolimus can be used.

As you can see, the study at interim made it through the interim analysis by the IDMC and they recommend it to continue the study to completion without modification. The recruitment itself is about to finish. We literally have only a few patients left. There is always a higher – by the nature of an interim, there is always a higher bar to achieve at interim analysis to close the study because you have to be very careful that you do it appropriately. So, we're not at all worried. We remain extremely confident in the data set.  The primary endpoint in the chronic graft-versus-host disease study is an overall response rate at month 6, but there are numerous secondary endpoints that are important here including failure-free survival, symptom improvement, overall survival and others. So, sometime in 2020 we'll get those results. We remain extremely confident in that. And as I – just to reiterate, it was a little unusual for us to guide to an interim, but again working with a partner, that's what we did. In terms of reading through to itacitinib in a more JAK1 agent relatively more – hits JAK1 more than the other JAKs, we saw our proof-of-concept data for itacitinib. It was strong across the spectrum of disease. But it was even stronger in steroid-naïve acute graft-versus-host disease, which is why – which led to GRAVITAS-301. In addition, patients with steroid-naïve acute graft-versus-host-disease are immediately post bone marrow transplant or allogeneic transplant tend to be sicker, tend to have cytopenia, particularly low white cell counts and low platelets. So, to have a relative JAK2 sparing agent that doesn't cause as much cytopenia as the others is potentially beneficial from a therapeutic ratio point of view.

So, that makes sense. In terms of timing, we're looking at the window between 25 and 30 and it's very obvious why. Because that's where we will need more diversification. So, some of the aspect is to complement our MF and PV franchises where there are new mechanisms that can be complementary to what we have in our portfolio and where obviously our leadership in MF and PV could be reinforced by external assets if any benefit could be shown from this. And then, we have a little bit of a longer view on the non-oncology aspect. As we said, we will be commercializing our rux cream in the US. We may have partnership, if needed, but we will be leading the commercialization in the US. We will be partnering our dermatology assets outside of Europe and US and we're still looking at what the best strategy for Europe.

Going forward, however, as we have discussed in the past, we are looking to invest in R&D based on the quality and the progress of the program. So, based on data and merits of the programs, if those programs progress through later-stage of development, you would expect that to drive R&D expenses. In terms of Q4, we reiterated the guidance that we provided on both R&D and SG&A because there is a timing factor for some of the expenses on both lines that we expect to be more back-end loaded into Q4 of 2019 and, therefore, we continue to be comfortable with the initial guidance that we have provided.",AID_8,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

But their EBITDA loss on that was $145 million and the free cash flow loss was $256 million. So that's what happened in their wireless.

We will not go add aimless taxes and fees simply to raise revenues or ARPUs, no trickery like the big guys are doing.And I think if you look at the cable industry is an example of what happens when an industry is unchecked with the Un-carrier of the industry like we are. Pretty clearly if you look at the results of those players, what they're doing is they're losing video customers, buying wireless customers and gouging broadband customers because, in the broadband, they have no competition. That's what it looks like when you play that game. We look forward to going into that industry as well.

We violently agree on all the things that are important -- all the things that are important to the states and violently agree of what the New T-Mobile can do. So, if you think about the federal agencies, they've now approved -- the expert agencies that have approved this deal, it's been about ensuring 5G investment and 5G build and rural coverage and broadband competition, concerns about pricing, concerns about the low end of the market. And what we've been able to do as you've seen recently with both Colorado and Mississippi is once you speak to these individual attorneys general about their state and the things that are important to them, they see that what they are concerned about is committed to nationally and can be tailored for them, so have been very good discussions and we continue to have those. They continue to center around 5G, and the build and pricing and around DISH as a competitive player, which first question we have been very aggressive with the consent decree on positioning for that.So, we feel very good about the conversations and where they're headed. And we feel very good and confident either in the process of a settlement or even going to trial and having the case seen well. And to your point, first question the kinds of things that the New T-Mobile will signal that we will do, whether it'd be an Un-carrier move or the plans that will start to unveil, they are very powerful items of discussion with the states as well, because they answer the main question.

I mean, we now have churn that's better than AT&T's. Our churn is in line with Verizon's. If you look at total postpaid, it's actually below Verizon's. So we're arriving at that industry best. And that's not to suggest that the tailwinds are necessarily epic, but we have to be aware of we are arriving at industry best. Neville said $200 million on 600 megahertz, that leaves $100 million -- some million [ph] to go. And a lot of customers, 26 million have the handsets, a lot of customers don't. So there's lots of benefit on the network side, lots of benefit on the customer experience side that we can continue to bring to the fore.The other piece is that we're experiencing structural low industry churn, which is both good and bad. We see the good side of it and that we don't have to spend so heavily on activations as many activations, but on the other hand, it decreases, our opportunity. And the good news is that we have the chance to win one way or the other. Take a potential 2020 with a 5G super cycle of phones and elevated switching and elevated upgrades versus today, if that were to happen, there'll be more gross adds in the market. And as you know, we are the net share winner in this market. And so, if there aren't structural reductions in churn next year, we can look to other parts of the growth equation like activations because the two happen to go hand in hand. So the real question is, how do we compete in the competitive millimeter [ph]; and as you saw, we took 48% of postpaid phone net adds this quarter. And as long as we can continue to manage both sides of the equation, churn and activations, then we'll be able to thrive, whether it's a low structural churn a quarter or a higher structural churn a quarter.",AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

We're delighted that our major partners with the big flagship devices, were able to get our 600 megahertz LTE technology on the devices last year, and as a result, we now have 26 million people with that technology in their hands. And I think that bodes very well for us as we think about our future in 5G, which again we have a big opportunity to get the ecosystem aligned.And I don't think it's going to take incentives to get people to try T-Mobile 5G. They're going to move to it very enthusiastically. Our strategy is going to look -- so as John was just saying, our strategy is going to look so different from our competitors. They're doing -- in particular, Verizon is making a bet that people will want versions of 5G that work in some places, very limited places and don't work in most places versus a 5G that works nationwide and that were willing to back with maps. And that's the beginning of a journey to the premise of your question. When you combine it with where we're going in the New T-Mobile, the journey towards the only 5G network that is both broad as we're talking about at nationwide and everywhere, and deal with transformational capacity and speeds that really can change the use cases for our consumers in very profound ways.It's a little early to predict all the applications and innovations. But I can tell you one thing as somebody that's been close to software, innovators are going to choose the network that's both broad and deep, that relies on having 5G everywhere. You're going to see use cases that are designed more to our way of thinking than to Verizon's way of thinking, which is that some people want 5G in a few places to be very high capacity and everywhere else, you'll be relegated to LTE. I don't think that will inspire the same kind of mobile innovation that we're going to see the T-Mobile -- the New T-Mobile network inspire.",AID_8,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

And frankly, it's a real opportunity for a win-win, or almost call it found money. And so it's a chance potentially for a revenue stream for DISH before their spectrum is used. And for us it can have a significant positive impacts to us if the price is right, especially from a standpoint of migration. So never say never, one thing that we become experts at in the last year is negotiating with DISH, and it's difficult process, but I think in this case, there is a real win-win possibility for both sides.

And it's something that our customers love and that they believe we have a role in their video live and in their mobile video subscriptions, and in their consumption.See, at the premise of your question, that has emboldened us as we think about the next steps in the strategy. We announced a strategic partnership with Quibi, the initiative formed by Jeffrey Katzenberg, and led by Meg Whitman, and we're very excited to be partnered with them. You mentioned our Viacom partnership, and they're plenty more opportunities, because in this world as it's changing, consumers are faced with an exciting world of OTT video, but a confusing one. And we have shown through Netflix on us that there is a role that they trust us to play in helping them choose, helping them authenticate, helping them pay for their video choices.

And as John said in his comments, this quarter, we were not only at the best levels we've ever seen for Q3, our overall postpaid churn when you look at the whole postpaid business which is not something we normally disclose, we focus more on phones, was the lowest in the industry, again, lower than Verizon, lower than AT&T. So that takes some pressure off the activation engine and you can see that start to translate into efficiencies in our business, which is terrific to see.This morning, we doubled down on that same strategy, this time with a breakthrough new offer for first responders. And it follows our very successful mold of really focusing on military, which we've been at for quite a few quarters now and really winning hearts and minds, and I think doing great work for military families and saving them an incredible amount of money.

And if you look at the midpoint of our projection, will be kind of mid-single-digit. So, that's definitely a significant improvement. And if you look at automotive, it's been kind of high-single-digit decline year-over-year through the first three quarters. And what we're -- at the midpoint, we're kind of at a 2% decline. So, I think that's really what we're trying to talk about. That's the basic indicator that we have the things are improving. It's based on the run rates that we have from our customers and their demands, we see that improving.Now, you also have to look at our mobile and communications and infrastructure to get to the total. And in total, we've been -- if you adjust for the MSA that we changed in the counting, we've been kind of mid-single-digit with the exception of Q2 where we were a little less than that. And we'll be kind of -- we'll have a couple points improvement in the total, even with a little bit of downtick in the communications and mobile in Q4.

We actually had some late shipments out on POS late in the quarter that actually allowed our inventory to go down to the 2.3 months. I think, that we’ll see -- we will see an uptick in distribution. I think, it has tended, as you pointed out, to be more volatile than OEM side. And I think it will be more relevant towards the uptick associated with it.

When you think about us indeed, I'd say that the improvement you're seeing is probably not restocking but it's just that the consumption reflects more the end demand. There earlier, at least in our business with smaller accounts and through distribution, it was marked by building down inventories.

And in Q3, clearly, we had a broader base, as well as our Tier 1 customer increased volumes as well. But, all the other Chinese customers showed the strength in Q3 also. So, yes, we had a really strong quarter in Q3.

So, if you will, this is a very clear evidence on our success over incumbents with one of the most, I would say bullish commitments from a car company into building electric vehicles. And that starts shipping as we speak. So, I mean, this is not just somewhere in the future, but actually the first models out of their whole fleet across a couple of fronts of that OEM are shipping as we speak.

But, we don't think it'll change the total because it really just gives us room to cover the downturn that we've been through in automotive and industrial and still have the confidence in achieving our 5% to 7% compounded growth rate going forward.I do think that there's a real opportunity, as we talked about, for low-teens growth rate in the RF power business with 5G deployment, over the next few years, and with our leadership position puts us in a good position. And we're just making some early investments in the last mile with some of the customer engagements that could bode very well as well and end up with a couple hundred million dollars a year of revenue in the not too distant future.So, all of that's positive, but, we're just kind of leaving our growth rates that we said a year and a half or so ago, intact and not really changing those by piece at this point, John.",AID_6,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

That's the latest impact we have. So, unfortunately, that indeed indicates that it has further deteriorated this year. So, we had earlier in the year minus 4%, minus 5%, and now they end up at minus 6% defined for ‘19.We have always said that on a quarterly basis, you cannot really benchmark our revenue performance against the SAAR, given all the supply chain effects in between. At the same time, we do continue to clearly say that we have all reason to believe that our business is outgrowing the SAAR, thanks to the electronic content increase per car. And I think, we are now at a point going into Q4 where it appears that the supply chain should become more or less clean, so our growth, which you see in our business, becomes more reflective of the true automotive demand from the OEMs. And that is indeed then leading to annual, and that's how we look at annual growth rate in Q4, which is only minus 2 versus much higher declines in the earlier quarters, like minus 7 and minus 10 in Q3 and Q2.We don't really guide for next year, Ross. And yes, I would say that once the supply chain is clear, we should expect that our growth by content should be reflected again in our numbers against the SAAR.

We have -- we believe a wealth of data suggesting that with a covalent inhibitor, a couple hours of exposure above a threshold leads to complete inhibition of signaling over that dosing interval. And we're convinced that our 960-milligram dose achieved that and in fact is well above that target threshold.Now that said, of course, it's very common in small molecule development programs early in the clinical development program to explore alternative doses and schedules and we will do that as part of the clinical pharmacology program going forward, including split dosing such as BID.",AID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

No one survives this. This is bad, and despite GARDASILand vaccines, not everyone gets vaccine across the globe and in the U.S., and so there is still unfortunately a need for therapies for relapsed cervical cancer.And if you look at perhaps the most recent approval in cervical cancer, it was pembro in PD-1 high-expressers with a 14%, that's 14% response rate, but they were durable responses. And if you look at chemotherapy that has been used in a lot of publications, there are, I would say the range is probably somewhere between 8% and maybe 16%, 17% response rate sometimes with durations that are tiny measured in two months of duration whereas with a checkpoint you can get a year or so of duration which is likely why it got approval even with the de minimis response rate because it had duration.So, I think those maybe could help you give you some landmarks of what's out there, and clearly we want to do well by patients and have the best response we can have with single agent, look at this in future in combination.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

We've run a number of very large clinical trials and while we're continuing to do additional work some of which you heard on the call today. It's becoming a probably a lower overall percentage of our investment in R&D, what is now really starting to come forward are investments in programs like ECD, where as you heard today, we've got a very expansive development program for that compound as well as tucatinib.I think HER2CLIMB data to us turns this into a program, not a clinical trial. You've heard a little bit about our work that's already starting in combination with Kadcyla in lines of therapy before the HER2CLIMB setting. And then first question we're looking at things like colorectal cancer where the data that we presented as well were quite encouraging.So, you know, I think maybe to get back to your question, I think you'll see a growing share of expense hitting programs like enfortumab and tucatinib. ADCETRIS will continue to be substantial, but probably becoming a smaller contributor to the overall pie. And then, we'll obviously look to see what else comes out of the pipeline.

1600,3053,22587,22587,"So, you know, there has been a lot of work done. I am looking at CD30 expression in both CTCL and in PTCL. And if you asked scientifically, are there patients with PTCL and CTCL that are absolutely negative for CD30? I could not with a clear conscience say that there are patients that are truly negative. What I could tell you is, there are some patients that have low scores on histology when looking at a single nodule, but if you look at other nodules they could be high.Keep in mind. CD30 is an activation antigen. And if you take some tissues that are low or in background with histology and you do other types of techniques to look at expression, you can see CD30 expression there. So, to me it's not totally -- is our CTCL and PTCL CD30 positive or negative. It's more of a, what the rate, what the expression level is and some really in the background of histology, which is kind of a blunt tool although readily used across different cancer centers. So it's an easy tool to use.So, having said that, you're asking about what could we do about that? How can we grow? And there have been trials done and evaluated -- for instance in CTCL that were presented not that long ago, showing that you have CD30 positive and in CD30, I will call histology negative. And then the doctors treated both populations and had really good responses in both. So, it was a little bit higher in the CD30 positive than the CD30 histology negative, but they first question weren’t CD30 negative.And so, I think there a lot of things that we could do as we get out there and just product is in the field longer and study this and Roger, you know a lot about expression of this.

And we're excited about that and we expect that ADCETRIS over time year-to-year will continue to grow as a brand as we make more progress there, but the specifics of PTCL for instance as you asked is not something we present.What I will say is that would PTCL we had OS from our first data set. So it is a less challenging discussion with doctors when you go out with OS data. Whereas with Hodgkin lymphoma it was contemplated to be – to take a number of years to get there because you need a certain amount of events to hit statistical volumes, so we are not there and it is important for us to follow the protocol as it said and as it's written and try to get to those events.But in the meantime, the gold standard is five years and docs look at that with Hodgkin lymphoma. Our additional data, which we published showed two-year worth of data and some doctors and it was great data some doctors converted and some didn't. And then last year we put out our three years data and we had a nice bump in our revenues and more docs took it on and the data got actually better, it wasn't just continuation of two to three years it look better.And now this year, we're going to show at ASH coming up in a couple of months, we're going to show four-year data and then next year, presumably at ASH, but it's way too early to speculate we'll show the five-year gold standard data.

So we are really excited about our newest ADC in clinical trials that we call 228A and targets CD228 or what's referred to as PA97 and this is expressed on a variety of solid tumors. And we have also not only just used this target, but we have used that new confirmation in ADC that utilizes pet groups, utilizes and implode, you may be aware that with ADCETRIS and with LV we utilized approximately 4 drugs per antibody molecule and with our newest technology with 228 we're using 8 drugs per antibody molecule. But it has a completely different linker and in a completely different stabilization agent and we've been working on this and it's in clinic now and it's an exciting prospect for us.One of the commitments that we've made is after we became the industry leader in ADC is to stay there and that's to continue investing in our technology and continue to make drugs that are more potent but also safer and try to work on our liquid systems to make them more specific for the tumor. And so, this is one example where we are very hopeful with our technology and we are investing in new ADCs.But as you will see going forward, we have a couple of new technologies to build on what we already have is the leadership positions.

And first question that response rate is high proof of synergy is a very different thing, which requires a high level of scientific vigor. And what I can say, is that from a mechanistic perspective, you think about what an [indiscernible] years so it’s essentially a targeted therapy.So delivering a payload to a group of tumor cells inducing in those tumor cells things like immunogenic cell death, replicas of stress, such that the tumor microenvironment may become favorable for an inflammatory response and may in fact be amenable then to an immune response that would be assisted by taking the brakes off at immune response by getting a PD-1 or PD-1 inhibitor. And in the sense of chemotherapy may be much more permissive in terms of what other cells could potentially damage, one could speculate that that limited delivery of a cytotoxic payload, just the tumor cells may keep the microenvironment more intact. That's one possibility.With regard to the actual data, in terms of what does - could 71% represent synergy? What is interesting is, if you look at the data you can see that there is a response regardless of PD-L1 expression, which is encouraging. We don't have EV monotherapy data at this point to sort of make the comparison. So it's very hard from a pure numbers perspective to say, this is what you'd expect with pembro, and this is what you could expect from EV.

And I kind of go back to some comments made by your primary competitor on their call, I think, talking about tightness in their own 14-nanometer supply, and also that they maybe not addressed some of the lower tiers of the market yet, your ASPs are up quite strongly. I wonder how much some of the supply tightness from your competitor might have led to these gains versus what sort of the merits of your own product? If there’s anything you could talk about that, Lisa, that’d be really helpful? ",QID_7,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral

But you also have some legacy product, right, and we continue to sell some legacy product as well. And so that’s the – that’s perhaps the other piece.But I think, as Devinder said, look, we’re very happy with the way the gross margin has progressed. I think, if you look at our long-term model, we had said 40 to 44 points and we’ll be exiting the year at 44.

But the way to think about it at a high level is, we are going to a product transition with Semi Custom now. And in 2019, for example, we’ve had the unusual cycle where the second-half of 2019 is pretty soft for Semi Custom compared to the first-half. And what you should expect in 2020 is that that would flip strongly.So I think both of our large customers have said that, they’re planning a holiday 2020 launch. That would mean that the Semi Custom business would be quite heavily weighted in the second-half. So you should expect that revenue in the first-half will be, again, quite soft, with a strong recovery in the second-half of the year. And the way I look at it is, the gaming business, the console business is a strong business for us.

So you’re up, you said more than 50% this quarter, so that might be what $80 million to $100 million maybe sequentially, which is, I guess, good. Your competitor added almost a $1.5 billion sequentially in data center this quarter.So when you say next quarter that you’re, I mean, I guess you did gain share, you got 50%, your units were up 20%, but even so. So when you’re saying next quarter, you’re going to grow by strong double digits on EPYC. Do you think that that’s like better than the trend that we saw in Q3, it’s more stuff around? So I mean, if we were up 50% sequential in Q3, do you think we could be better than that in Q4?

We had a full quarter of revenue here in the third quarter, and we saw that in sort of the ramp of units and revenue.What we are seeing is that, the qualifications are going faster with the second-generation of EPYC than with the first-generation, so customers are familiar with our platforms. In some cases, customers are doing drop-in platforms, and so they can take virtually the same or a very similar platform that they had for first-gen and drop-in the second-gen, they’re familiar with our architecture.And so, I think, from a market share standpoint, we feel good about the transition from Naples to Rome. I think the platform readiness across our OEMs and number of platforms that we have across the major OEMs is also very strong, and we’re pleased with the set that are – that have both new and existing platforms there.And so, from the standpoint of where we are going in the fourth quarter into 2020, I think we feel very, very good about where we are with the data center customers.

And I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street, as well as just general go-to-market around commercial.Starting with Ryzen. I think, you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger. And it’s not just the number of platforms, but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have a very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well.What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is a stronger part of the PC market. And we’ll continue to talk about that as it relates to new platforms. Certainly, as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think, you’ll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We’re investing heavily in security and manageability and all those other aspects that are important in the commercial space.As it relates to EPYC in the enterprise, I’m actually very encouraged with what we see in the enterprise. We had originally said that, we thought we would be more cloud, sort of cloud would go first and then enterprise would take longer. I think, what we currently see is, cloud is first question a big driver of our business, but our enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I really would say that, the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly.We have had a number of engagements. I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in enterprise across our top OEM has increased very significantly, just in the last sort of two months since we launched.

Is pricing and margins coming in pretty much in line with expectations, or are they coming in a little bit better?And then as you think about the margin profile for that business going into 2020, given 7-nanometer potentially maturing into next year, given the mix and given the change in customer mix from cloud to enterprise, so those two dynamics serve as tailwinds for your margins in that business?",QID_19,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral

And so, in most cases, total cost of ownership is definitely in the conversation. And it’s not just about performance, but performance at a given power level and also in terms of given density. And that has played out in a number of our customer engagements.And so, the overall point of – we think that Rome is very well-positioned. Price in and of itself is one factor, but I would say it’s not the primary factor. I think the performance, power, total cost of ownership are all important buying factors.

We expect that to continue to go – grow as we go into Q4 and into the first-half of next year.So this is about more platforms ramping and multiple platforms within a given customer.

I think those are very attractive products and really taking the full advantage of the EPYC product line. We are seeing, as you might expect, with that mix that the Rome ASPs are showing lift versus the previous first-generation EPYC.As we go forward, you would expect that to build out a little bit more. So, we have a full product portfolio for the server parts. But then you also expect that, you’ll get more enterprise in that and enterprise tends to have a higher ASP. So the net of all that is, I can say in the server market, we feel very good about where we’re positioned from an ASP standpoint.

What I will say, though, is put in context, that the product has basically been in market since early August.And if you put that in context and we’re saying that the transition is going quickly. And we have a number of new platforms that are – literally they’ve been in market four to eight weeks. With the way that server cycles goes, I’m actually pretty happy with how it’s ramping.

So, the only thing I would say and I said it earlier, is the product mix is perhaps a little bit higher in the early part of the ramp. But overall, the margins are pretty close to what we expected. The pricing environment is pretty close to what we expected.And as we go into 2020, I think, the other piece of it is that the business scale will increase as we grow the business.

So, Timothy, the way I would answer that question is, we’ve made a set of choices, and the set of choices include process technology, they include architecture, our chiplet architecture, they include sort of our overall system architecture. And I think we’ve made it set of good choices.Going forward, we are not relying on process technology as the main driver. We think process technology is necessary. It’s necessary to be sort of at the leading edge of process technology. And so, today, 7-nanometer is a great node, and we’re getting a lot of benefit from it. We will transition to the 5-nanometer node at the appropriate time and get great benefit from that as well. But we’re doing a lot in architecture.

Desktop was higher than mobile, but both grew very nicely.If you look at GPUs overall, they actually declined a bit sequentially, and that decline was primarily driven by data center GPUs, which declined just due to some of the buying cycles in the cloud. Overall, gaming did well, and we continue to expect that.

There have been some platform, sort of optimizations that we’ve done through working with our ODM partners and the motherboard partners to try to sort of improve the optimization of the maximum boost frequency, which is, I think, what you’re referring to. And that has largely been addressed over the last couple of weeks. But I would consider that more of a optimization versus any type of major update, and we – we’re going to continue to improve the platform.So you’re going to see that, as is normal with a new platform that will continue to improve the platforms over time.

But I guess, there’s other parts that relate to your fundamental architecture, which is the chiplet memory density in your IPC advantage. So I guess, can you kind of break down, Lisa?

Clearly, we see pricing more pronounced in emerging markets and in North America, where the inflationary pressure has been a little bit higher than in Europe. Europe growth is mostly driven by volume. I think you see AMEA with combined strong volume growth and pricing. I'm happy to report clearly that North America has returned to volume growth this quarter.So, overall, we really like the algorithm. It is more volume-driven in developed markets, where margins are higher, and emerging markets, in relative terms, we see a little bit less volume and more pricing which again we like. So, in the big scheme of things, it is quite balanced and it is offsetting the inflationary pressure. We see quite frankly, though, that is also because we covered our commodity and ForEx exposure quite well.

1677,3055,11159,11159,"So first, just a clarification, Luca, on the Brazil issue, this just sounds like it'll linger in Q4, are you expecting a similar magnitude in Q4 relative to Q3, and then it's really next year when you start to see that drag dissipate?",QID_5,Question_1_Market_related,Question_2_specific,Question_3_attack
1678,3055,17746,17746,"And then, Dirk, can you walk us through some of the bigger chocolate markets, where Mondelez entered the last few years, but not necessarily has scaled pretty big into specifically China and the U.S.? What's your latest thinking about what the near, medium, and long-term opportunity is for both those markets?",QID_10,Question_1_Market_related,Question_2_open,Question_3_attack
1679,3055,3459,3459,"Yes, let me maybe just start by saying that Brazil for us is a large and complex market. We have clearly a big portfolio in there that spans pretty much across all the categories that Mondelez competing globally. We have a good set of global and local brands. And as you say, entering Q3 we had a material negative impact that was anticipated for the most part, and this negative impact quite frankly explains the entirety of the profit shortfall that we had in LA in the quarter versus last year. As you said, the issues are two-fold. As we discussed in the last quarter, some plant closures caused transition issues. We ended up line startups that were delayed and we faced extra cost. We ended up scrapping more products than we wanted to. And in addition to that, we had some extra logistics cost. I would say this first issue accounts for pretty much half of the material profit gap we saw in the quarter in LA and in Brazil, as I said.And the second issue is about powdered beverages, which is a material category for us both in terms of top and bottom line. The category itself is quite challenged at the moment, and our shares of market are declining. The declining trend accelerated a bit in Q3 versus what we saw in the first part of the year. And that resulted in revenue and profit shortfalls, also compounded by the fact that in a declining category and share environment we had to take out some trade stock in the quarter. So we're working on both fronts. And we are making good progress and with our supply chain. But as we said very clearly in Q3, we will still have some impacts in Q4, but the issue should get materially better as we enter 2020.For PBs, the issue is a little bit more accentuated, and it will take some time for us to address both the category and the share decline dynamics. I would also like to take the opportunity that you provided with your question to reiterate a couple of things. Despite, as I said in my written remarks or recorded remarks, the materiality of the issues in Brazil, and the fact that we are lapping the highest gross margin in Q3 last year, our virtuous cycle is working. GP, NOI are both growing sort of 4% on a year-to-date basis. As I said, when you take out Brazil gross margins, NOI margins are both up on a year-to-date basis. We are delivering the volume leverage and SG&A leverage as we planned.We continue with cost discipline. I think you see in the quarter a good number for SG&A. That number includes an increase in A&C, but the embedded ZBB behaviors we have are delivering savings. And all of these quite frankly gives me confidence that the model is working, and that we will deliver on our long-term ambition to grow OI and GP more than revenue. So, not ideal what we saw in Brazil in the quarter, but in the big scheme of things when you strip it out I think the model is working and the long-term algorithm we have in mind is safeguarded.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

1682,3055,20085,20085,"Yes. I'm Luca. If you really look at percentages, I think on a year-to-date basis, we are under about 40%. I think we closed last year at 40.2%. So if we really want to dissect to the decimal points, yes, we are few decimal points behind. I don't think, Jason, there is anything structural besides Brazil. And Brazil again, as I dissect the issue, there is part of it that is going to persist to a certain extent into next year, and it is the powder beverage part of it. On supply chain, we should be fixed. I think as you look at all the components of the gross profit delivery, volume leverage is there. I think when you look at the volume mix that is 2%, that is a good number, I think that provides material leverage both into the GP line and the overhead line, and I think we see it coming into fruition.In terms of pricing, last year, we announced a couple of ways of pricing in the U.S. market, and I think as you look at the biscuit market specifically, you see volume and value going up. In that context, we are gaining share. I think in emerging markets, we clearly have the pricing discipline that is required. And quite frankly, it is a little bit more sophisticated than going out and announcing big price increases. It is leveraging the full array of pricing tools that we have, including previous optimization, promo intensity, price spec architecture, and as I answered before, if I look at the composition of the commodity and ForEx inflation, and the pricing, we have taken business unit by business unit, I think we did a good job in both emerging and developed markets. And productivity, it is a little bit lower than in the past years, not because gross productivity isn't there, it is there, but we are facing a little bit more inflation on the labor front and the logistics costs.So, as I dissect the gross margin components, and I take myself in a context where I say, ""Okay, Brazil is a little bit of an outlier. Do I see us having material issues on price net of commodities, productivity, volume leverage?"" The simple answer is ""No."" I think the one point is mostly attributable to Brazil, it is attributable to the fact that in Q3 last year, the number was higher than the rest of the year, 40% with Brazil embedded into the number, I don't think it is for us something that we should worry structurally about. I think, having said that, we need to continue working well on delivering volume on getting the productivities and pricing in line with inflation we see in the marketplace.",AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

1684,3055,1117,1117,"The first thing I would like to say is that the strategy is working well. We are pleased with our progress. We see good momentum in the business; we are delivering on and above our goals. Everything we put in motion a year ago about consumer-centric organization and increasing our speed, execution, and results, it's all working out probably faster than we expected. And in this quarter we saw some quality net revenue growth and also year-to-date as it relates to volume mix and price. The mix between developed markets and emerging markets or between global and local brands as the balance is there.And the category is strong, as you pointed out, Andrew. In many cases it's driven by us since we play -- we're a major player in the categories. And yes, we do have some challenges in Latin America, but otherwise our overall performance from net revenue through gross profit into OI is a very healthy equation, and it shows that the top line growth we're having combined with the cost discipline is working out for us. We did call up our full-year outlook to 3.5%-plus net revenue growth and an EPS of 5% to 7%. That means that, yes, we expect that Q4 will be a little bit lower. I would say, as you pointed out, Andrew, the first thing to keep in mind is the longer Easter season that we have this year, which will have an effect or lessen -- no affect in Q4, if I can say it like that.In Q3, we also lapped the heat wave we had last year in Europe which was beneficial to us, so that had a benefit. And so in Q4 we will not see any of these benefits. And overall we feel that our categories are somewhere between 3% to 4% growth, not fully the 4% that we saw in Q4. And we think that the categories will go back to a normal growth rate of around 3%-plus as we've been seeing all the time in reality. As it relates to 2020, we continue to see big opportunities for us to keep on driving the categories to improve our market share and increasing our investment in our brands, in our capabilities, but we have to remain a little bit mindful again about Brexit, which didn't happen this year, but it will have an affect or potential on the first quarter.

Dirk alluded clearly to, or actually said that in Q3 the execution of Cadbury Dairy Milk and the campaign with Cadbury Dairy Milk Generosity is working very well, and we have seen material share gains.

So we clearly see the effect on our brands and we feel that we're getting a good return. Of course, we want those local brands to grow in line with the markets and they're about there, but there is still we feel the opportunity to keep on investing more. An example would be a brand like Pacific in China, which is very local brand, which is adapted to local flavors, biscuit brands, and it also has a health and wellness connotation. So that plays well, we're revamping LU in Belgium and France. And there's a number of these brands around the world which we think we need to really offer a full portfolio to our consumers.

And this year, the investment was focused on an increase in our A&C, and increase in route-to-market investments, and to R&D, so innovation. So, Luca was talking about this virtuous cycle, which we want to continue. If I look at what that means for us going forward, I do not expect substantially these investments to change. We do have still areas of the world where we should be putting more and see investment in our brands, particularly the local brands which are accelerating, but they are yet not always on the right level of investment. We still have big route-to-market opportunities, if I think about China, India, where we have to go in third and fourth tier cities. And we for several years we want to be keep on investing, and you can imagine the same for places like Southeast Asia or Africa, where we need to keep on doing that.And then in R&D, we do want to continue to push on more agility and faster speed, and maybe a little bit less in the years to go forward than we did this year, but it's going to be largely the same three buckets that we are going to invest in. I would also say that apart from increasing our investment, we are also moving more of the investment within A&C into working media. And on top, we are trying to drive the ROI of our marketing spend. We've done things like consolidations of our agency, which drives value and gives us a more consistent quality globally, and we are also working quite hard on our point of sales execution investment, which we will continue next year.

1704,3055,30011,30011,"So, to your first part of the question, we didn't comp anywhere. Our PB expenses are up materially in Q3 actually more than only year-to-date basis. So, we protected the A&C investment, as these said many times there are a couple of things to bear in mind there. The first one is we are also skewing more towards working media. So that number that on the face of which is high in terms of total A&C is even higher in terms of working media and in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. And the second element that has to be kept in mind is that management -- first question management sitting at this table, but also management sitting in the business unit is not getting any past four A&C reductions in terms of incentive. So, if we deliver profit in a quarter through copying A&C, the number is not going count in terms of incentive that we're going to get at the end of the year, and I think that is an important step forward for the past, and the last thing we are going to do is copy and see even in a context where maybe -- we're under a little bit of pressure from a profit delivery.In Brazil, we did comp some A&C, but it was due to the fact that, we clearly didn't see it working. So, we are not going to be blind and say, yes, let's spend whatever, and no matter what, but I want to reassure that front, we're not going to do anything that we will regret in the medium to long-term. The PB categories in Brazil, it is north of $300 million. As I said, the category is a little bit challenged. We have big brands in there namely, Tang and Clight, and the local brand, which is called Fresh. We are facing a capital pressure point, one it is CSDs are taking share from the category, and the second element -- and so the category is shrinking a bit, and the second element is we are getting pressure from more competitive propositions and low price point propositions for consumers. So we are working on both and there is a more comprehensive plan we have in place for our beverages which hopefully will bring some positives, but I think it will take a little bit of time for that plan to really be in full effect and bring the capital back up and our share back up.",AID_16,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

I would say now that both markets have very significant players here in the U.S. and in China that we would be up against. So, we didn't want to have sort of a major strategy or a major approach.

One is the sale of our ownership interest in Thailand in fiscal 2019, and how that extends then, with its impact into fiscal 2020.

There were some temporary business transition activities, in fiscal 2019. And that are non-recurring. And they tend to mask the growth profile of our Channel Development business for fiscal 2020. And they relate primarily to lapping some elevated inventory sales to Nestlé in preparation for their direct fulfilment of customer orders, in addition to, what were some final sales of Tazo-branded products that fell into fiscal 2019. So, when you normalize for these temporary transition items in Channel Development and as well as for the ownership change in Thailand, we get back to a normalized total revenue growth rate of 7% to 9%. What I would like to highlight specifically in relation to Channel Development, given that we are guiding to an adjusted revenue growth rate of 4%, which is at the bottom end of our ongoing range of 4% to 6% is that, we would expect it to be 4% to 5% in the near-term and then 5% to 6% longer term with what we expect by way of an accelerated pace of international market expansion. So really what you see happening is a combination of things. Number one, it's overlapping some unusual benefits that we realized in fiscal 2019. But it's also the fact that the international market acceleration and how that impacts the shape of our revenue growth for the Channel Development segment particularly, we see happening further out into the future.",AID_6,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

I'm wondering using 2020 hindsight here maybe what you think were the greatest challenges over the fourth quarter period or so where it seems like the comp trends were really challenged whether you thought it was internal or macro or competition? What do you think kind of resurrected that business? And with that as a backdrop, again, having done mid-single-digits the past two quarters just wondering why you think the fiscal 2020 guidance for 1% to 3% is appropriate when it seems like you're on track and running ahead of that level?

Even as I listened to this call, it sounds like there is an interesting contrast where China's more of a digital flywheel story with that 45% growth in rewards and you had that big jump up in digital order partly fueled by delivery. In the U.S., you've had that mid-teens growth in rewards users. But all the while this year you've been ramping up as your cold beverage growth seems to be ramping. So I wanted to ask you, do you agree with that characterization in terms of the top drivers in each market? And how do you think those will play out in fiscal 2020?

1712,3056,28193,28193,"Great. Thank you. Sol just on those digitally registered customers that we've seen in this recent quarters first of all, we've seen the redemption shifted to new tiers and that's not impacting our overall Starbucks Rewards growth. The customers we've seen they've embraced the choices provided by these multiple redemption tiers. The 150-Star tier continues to see the majority of the redemption volume. And we've also seen that our low-frequency members that you've heard us referred to as our occasional customers they're driving a more significant portion of the active members. So right now we're seeing good movement in that space. And again our Starbucks Rewards customers we've seen acceleration there in that member growth of about 15% to roughly 18 million members. Actually that number is 17.6 million. The other thing I'll mention is that we continue to grow at peak in our morning peak time frame and we're seeing actually growth across all dayparts. That occasional customer that we're introducing to Starbucks Rewards is coming in in the afternoons. And so we probably are seeing a lift through all the dayparts.

I know in the past you've talked about the digital information you have now on people who are not yet rewards members and I think you've given that number in the past. I'm just curious if that continues to grow in the U.S? And then secondarily on the margin outlook, I guess, I'm a little confused on the Americas particularly. I know the margin there has stabilized. So you had some benefit from the change in the gift card breakage.

Growth at Scale has really enabled us to really sharpen our focus on those things that we believe differentiate Starbucks from all other opportunities and all other experiences. So the focus that we've put on the customer experience in our stores, the focus we've put on beverage innovation, the focus we've put on digital customer relationships and the fact that we have executed against this with discipline has driven our customer connection scores to an all time high. The brand is healthy and strong and growing. And so, in many ways our Growth at Scale agenda has really enabled us to put our energy behind the things that matter most and the things candidly that differentiate us from all others in the marketplace. And I think that is the significant reason why we're seeing transaction traffic growth, we're seeing comp growth and we're seeing momentum across all aspects of Starbucks.

Those three things are what's driving an all-time high in customer connection scores. That is in turn driving traffic growth. And those same three priorities that we've focused on throughout fiscal year 2019 will be the same ones we continue to drive in fiscal year 2020.

1718,3056,29419,29419,"And then Sharon with respect to your question on margin, what I first want to clarify is that we are expecting modest margin improvement across each one of our segments in fiscal 2020. Specifically on the Americas you asked about breakage and then just Americas margin generally. So I first want to clarify what's happening with breakage. As a reminder we adopted this new revenue recognition accounting standard starting in first quarter fiscal 2019. And one that impact of that was to reclassify stored value card breakage from the interest in other line below operating income and outside of segment results to the revenue line at the segment level. It's mostly a matter of P&L geography that does not have an impact on EPS. On a full year basis, the change in accounting did have a beneficial impact to non-GAAP operating margin of about 40 basis points in fiscal 2019 and the greatest impact was in Q2 due to seasonality. But I also want to clarify that breakage is not accounted for in comp sales. It's just another revenue driver after new stores and comp sales. We will lap this impact in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 at which point the benefit to our revenue and operating margin will already be embedded in our base. So breakage will not be a driver of margin performance in fiscal 2020. We do expect in the Americas like the other segments that there will be a modest margin expansion in fiscal 2020. And that's a function of the sales leverage that we expect from the comp growth that we're guiding in the range of 3% to 4% as well as the significant cost savings that we're expecting, particularly in our supply chain, and that that will be sufficient to offset the investments that we're looking to make in fiscal 2020 to continue to drive the top line. I will also say that the Americas margin will benefit in 2020 -- fiscal 2020 from the lap of the leadership conference in the fourth quarter. So as you think about the shape of our margin performance across the year, what that means is it will probably be flattish in Q1. We'll see that modest improvement in Q2 and Q3, and then we will see a very robust margin improvement in the fourth quarter.",AID_7,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1719,3056,35704,35704,"There's a couple reasons, why we feel confident about our future in what we've been doing with the beverage innovation, the work we've been doing with in-store experience and our digital engagement. First of all, behind these things a lot of the work that we've done in-store is around the work that we did with the team works rollout in third quarter fiscal year '19. And so we'll benefit a lot from that in fiscal year '20. Then there is a significant work in progress around inventory routines and automation, the food prep test that we do backroom optimization. And all of those items are fueling the work as Kevin mentioned around machine learning and our applications to fuel Deep Brew. So, we feel confident about that work that's ongoing and that is already in process. In terms of beverage innovation, because, we have been looking at not only beverage innovation, but equipment, having Mastrena there is an opportunity, having Nitro there. We introduced Cold Foam last year. It's allowing us to create new beverage combinations that our customers are really responding to in addition to the growth in cold. So, if you look at our sales in detail, cold which is our Refreshers, our iced teas, our cold coffee and our Nitro Cold Brew are all doing extremely well for us. And so that innovation will be ongoing. And then, from the point of the digital relationships, the more we learn about our customer base, the better we had been marketing to them. And so, you will see our marketing become more personalized and that will help with retention and driving frequency in our stores. So, we feel like there is more to come in those three areas, so we'll continue on the pathway we those three important initiatives for us because there's still more to be done in those areas.",AID_8,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1720,3056,19374,19374,"Yes. And David from a China standpoint I agree with what Kevin's comments were around the Chinese consumer and their digital capability and the savvy that they have. Just to put that into context, you've seen in our report our reported earnings the growth of the Starbucks Rewards program. So we up-leveled that December. We now have crossed the 10 million Starbucks Rewards members in China. We grew that 45% year-over-year. And our total member base is now in China sitting at 32.5 million which is up 66% over a year ago. So really just strong digital engagement from the customers, when you drill down a little bit deeper into MOP, we've expanded MOP at China speed. We're now at more than 2,600 stores across 15 cities and we're continuing to expand that program. So we've got about 65% of our store base covered. We're seeing a very strong healthy repeat on purchases where -- which is enabling us to bring new users into the Starbucks Rewards program and penetrate that more deeply. And then you translate that into the new channel of delivery. We're seeing good success in delivery. We stand out over 3,000 stores, in 100 cities. We now cover 80% of our store base. As we said, 7% of the sales mix, we're seeing a higher ticket, through delivery, and stronger food attach. And we're seeing morning and lunch day part increasing, so, very optimistic about that. And then, just don't lose sight of the need for us to continue to gain first-mover advantage on store growth. And we're going to continue to focus on accelerating our store growth. Clearly, the returns that we see in terms of new stores indicate, that there is a lot of opportunity in that area. And as we continue to cultivate, the coffee consumption in China, which now sits at less than four cups per year, per person, compared to 300 in the U.S. this is a huge opportunity. And then, just one other thing, and then, I'll stop, is the Global Coffee Alliance. And as Kevin shared, we spent the last few days, in China. We're here in Japan today, talking about the opportunity that the Global Coffee Alliance has for us in China. And we've announced that in August. We're rolling out across for platforms. We have over 20 products that we've launched. We walked the aisle, in Shanghai. The Starbucks presence is absolutely stunning. And then, foodservice is going to be a big opportunity as we focus in on office, as we focus in on universities, and as we focus in on the five-star hotels.

Obviously Nitro is relatively new across the system, but about how you feel about that beverage pipeline looking ahead? How much incremental opportunity there is on the in-store experience?

And for us, as Kevin highlighted in his comments, digital orders represent 10% of the business that we saw in the quarter, 7% of that coming through delivery which is an entirely new channel for us and then 3% coming through Mobile Order & Pay. So, digital has had a meaningful impact a positive impact on the business. And just beyond the comp performance we talk a lot about the acceleration of the store footprint and we had record new stores opened in the quarter. We continue to see very strong economic returns. We continue to see very strong revenue growth of 18% in the quarter, majority of that is driven by new stores.

1723,3056,10932,10932,"Okay. Thank you, Kevin. Sara, what I'd like to do first is maybe just step -- take a step back and talk about Q4 in total. In my prepared remarks, I talked about consolidated margin across all of fiscal 2019. I'd like to focus more specifically on Q4 here, because the dynamics were a bit different. So, on a reported basis, our non-GAAP operating margin of 17.2% represented a 90 basis point decline compared to Q4 of last year. But what I would highlight is that embedded in that is a 70 basis point impact from our leadership conference as well as a 30 basis point impact from streamline-driven activities. So when you exclude those, our non-GAAP operating margin actually improved 20 basis points. Now I think your point, admittedly a 20 basis point margin improvement seems very modest in the context of a 5% global sales comp for the quarter, particularly in relation to other quarters. So what I'd like to do is highlight what was unique to Q4, including recent trends impacting our flow through, which primarily relates to two margin drivers within our Americas segment. The first driver relates to the investments we're making to sustain long-term growth exactly to your point. Along with the tax reform funded investments in partner wages and benefits that we initiated in fiscal 2018, we invested in additional labor hours in Q4 to build on our positive sales momentum drive higher levels of customer connection and explore opportunities to unlock capacity in stores that we believe are best positioned to capture incremental sales at peak. This effort tested the upper limits of investment potential to determine where the future payback could be greatest in terms of incremental sales. This investment was not intended to completely payback during the quarter. However, it provided us and this was our goal with a substantial amount of data. And we're leveraging these insights to optimize our labor deployment going forward. This is the artificial intelligence and machine learning that Kevin referred to earlier. So, in addition to those labor hours, we also invested in store-level equipment, as Roz mentioned, to support new product platforms like Nitro Cold Brew and to improve our operating efficiency. So that's the first driver, it’s really in the area of investment. The second driver relates to inflationary pressures in wages and benefits as well as occupancy expense. Now consistent with our discussion in Q3, we are seeing margin pressure from continued increases in statutory minimum wages coupled with inflationary increases in rent, culinary maintenance and real estate taxes. All that said we do expect modest margin expansion in fiscal 2020 as we've guided as we continue to balance our investments with expected benefits from sales leverage and ongoing cost savings initiatives notably in our supply chain. Now, I'd also like to take a minute or two to talk about China, because of the dynamics there are slightly different. We do expect to continue to make investments there in order to sustain strong comp growth even as we have accelerated our pace of development. But one thing that is slightly different is product mix. Product mix in the last year -- and we foresee this continuing into fiscal 2020 is a bit of a headwind in China. And one of the drivers of that is the growth in our delivery sales mix. As we've discussed before, delivery transactions are on the margin dilutive to our total margin. However, they are highly incremental. So even while diluting our margin percentage, they grow total profit dollars. And that is different from what we are seeing in our U.S. where delivery is in the very early stages and growing more immodesty. So that is probably the key difference between China and the U.S. But what is consistent across both and is an important part of our strategy going forward is continuing to make those strategic investments in our business that strengthen key points of competitive difference and help us to sustain top line growth for the long term. But it does come at the expense of what would otherwise be much stronger margin expansion on the back of the consistent comp growth that we're expecting going forward.",AID_4,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

My question is on the Americas traffic strength you've seen; it seems like you've picked up some momentum here even as you look at relative to the last quarter you're cycling a tougher comparison.

Because with such good comps you talked about a little bit of the offset and the headwinds from some of these investments. So, in the Americas, when I look at the operating -- store operating expenses, it looks like it's grown a bit faster than top line. Should we expect that to be the case going forward, which is to say this year was more like a step up in some of the investments you are making in your partners? Or should we just expect that going forward in order to sustain the kind of service levels and customer and partner engagement you have, you're going to probably need to continue to invest at this pace?

And I think the benefits that both Roz and Kevin hit on are important benefits that we're seeing translate into the international markets as well. I would also just add that our partners absolutely love these machines and it gives them much more visibility to the customer due to the lower profile of the machine itself being able to interact with customers and engage with them.

1728,3056,15921,15921,"Yes. Let me just frame kind of my thinking at a high level David and then I'll hand over to Roz and John to comment specifically on U.S. and China. I do think that while we're focused on the same key things to create a great experience in our stores to drive beverage innovation that's relevant to our customers and to grow digital customer relationships the two markets are very different. Clearly, in China this past year, we've seen a significant step forward in our digital customer relationships. A lot of that driven with our China digital partnership with Alibaba, we introduced a spend-based rewards program in December. We launched the ability for mobile order for pickup. We launched Starbucks Delivers. And in China what you see is the consumer base in China is much more digitally savvy than any other market in the world. You just look at the percent of tender that's paid on the mobile app with Alipay or WeChat Pay. You look at the numbers scenarios in China that are digital mobile scenarios. And so the work that Belinda and Leo and our great China leadership team did this year in many ways was anchored around taking a big step forward in the digital flywheel. And that's where a year ago we didn't have mobile ordering for pickup or delivery. Now 10% of our sales mix is coming from that with seven points from Starbucks Delivers and three for mobile order for pickup. In the U.S., I think in that particular market, we've had digital flywheel and the active rewards member growth for several years now. And I think in the U.S. a lot of this was continuing to extend and accelerate that. But I think more importantly, the work that's gone into creating -- elevating the customer experience in our stores and really sharpening our focus on the beverage innovation, while at the same time expanding digital customer relationships has helped. I don't -- delivery Starbucks Delivers in the U.S. still is very small. It's less than 1% of our sales mix. And I think part of that is because the cost dynamics are different in China versus the U.S. And I think the Chinese consumer is much more advanced in these digital scenarios than in the U.S. But I think we're going to continue to watch and see how that evolves in the U.S. Let me hand over to -- so I guess the net is David I think we do have two very different markets with the consumer behavior and the state of evolution of Starbucks. And our capabilities in those markets continues to evolve in a way that's relevant to the customer mix in each of those two markets.

This is representing the work that we're doing with beverage innovation. We're continuing that expansion with Mastrena and should finish that work in the next 12 months or so.Kevin Johnson: Katherine, there's three key benefits of this new Mastrena machine that I want to really punctuate. Number one, is it can pull a triple shot espresso with one pull. Today in our older machines you have to pull a Doubleshot and then another single shot for any beverage that has three shots of espresso. So just that alone reduces the amount of time that a partner at the bar would need to take if they're preparing a beverage that has three shots of espresso in it. So that's number one big efficiency unlock. Number two, those machines have Internet of Things sensors built into them. And so we get telemetry data that comes into our support center. We can see every shot of espresso that's being pulled and we can see centrally if there is a machine that's out there that needs tuning or maintenance. And that allows us to improve the quality of the shots that we're pulling.

But it's premature to revise the ongoing long-term guidance that we provided at our 2018 Investor Day. Our policy is to guide conservatively communicating expected outcomes that we have a high degree of confidence we can deliver. It's the predictable sustainable growth that Kevin referenced earlier. Specifically in relation to China, the market dynamics there that are impacting our comp are unchanged from where they were a year ago. We are continuing to open new units at an accelerated pace. And of course that puts pressure on existing units through sales transfer. We're also continuing to see a slower overall growth rate in the economy. And we're seeing a more intense level of competition, I would say in part because of the success of that we've enjoyed and the opportunity we've highlighted in the specialty retail coffee category. So, when you take all of those together we believe that it is prudent to guide to comp growth in China in the range of 1% to 3% again consistent with our ongoing model.

We -- beverage innovation continued, but we also promoted beverages pretty heavily in the quarter. And so we promoted what the plans were for early July beginning with our flavored iced teas and then the fall beverage lineup highlighted by the pumpkin platform. And that helped immensely in addition to the work that we've done to free up the work and the administrative work of our partners in the stores so that they can engage with the customers, allowed them to have great interactions and we were able to see that in all dayparts. Additionally our drive-through business continues to grow well and you'll see that continue through fiscal year 2020. I will also mention that the work that we continue to do to engage our customers from a digital perspective has also been helpful particularly when we introduced multitier redemption.

1735,3056,24931,24931,"Yeah. So we've had some great work that's happened between us and Nestlé as we rolled out this -- the Global Coffee Alliance. Clearly, the U.S. market is the most established business. We had a smaller business in Europe, but then the rest of the world was Greenfield as it relates to CPG and foodservice channels. We now have products available in over 30 markets around the world. And as Kevin highlighted, we're on our way to having 50 markets up and running, by the spring of 2020. We've got 28 SKUs that we've launched across four different platforms. Particularly, the work that we've done with Nespresso is paying dividends. We're seeing very good strong growth and uptick for the Nespresso Starbucks-branded capsules. We're also seeing very good, strong uptick with Dolce Gusto, in the Dolce Gusto platform. So we're very optimistic about the single-serve opportunity that exists around the world, not just in the U.S. We did have a meaningful launch of creamers in the U.S. and we anticipate that -- taking that to other markets. We launched four flavors in August and we earned about 10.4 billion impressions as we made that announcement. So there is a lot of consumer excitement about this and a lot of market excitement. And then we're going to continue to drive meaningful innovation within the Global Coffee Alliance. I think at the speed at which we've been able to create the product platforms, the speed at which we've been able to bring those into the markets that is going to continue. And that's been a big piece of the discussions that we've been having here over the last 2.5 days with the Nestlé team and we're both very optimistic about the opportunity going forward.",AID_6,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

So on that, I think what we're continuing to see with Stories monetization is, that is a product that's experiencing a lot of impression growth. And whenever we have a product that's experiencing high impression growth that puts pressure on the auction in terms of price. And we've also seen good impression growth on the feed side as well. So if you noted in the commentary when I talked about the drivers of impression growth, I listed feed impressions from Facebook first. So I think that's also showing good growth. So I'd say overall not a big change in the gap there and overall the impression growth is really the story for Stories and will remain the story we think for the near future. So that will not be a price-driven revenue growth story, but rather an impression growth, revenue growth story.",AID_10,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1742,3057,16809,16809,"Sure. And then also just add something on privacy. I think it's very important that there is federal privacy legislation. GDPR encodes a lot of important principles and in order for businesses to be able to operate, especially starts to get started and keep the market competitive, you want to make sure that there aren't 50 different regulatory frameworks that companies need to follow. I mean, we could handle that if we needed to, we're a big company. But in terms of for the market overall, I just think it would be a lot better if we had a very clear set of rules at the federal level on privacy. So we'll continue to try to work with folks to try to do what we can to help there. On VR and AR, you're right. This is taking a bit longer than we thought. And I'm still optimistic, I think that the long-term vision and the reasons why I thought this -- we're going to be important and big are unchanged. So we're seeing a lot of people use these products and love them and because of that I think that we're still going to get there. Obviously, the fact that it's taking a little longer than we thought, it cuts both ways. On the one hand, that of course means that the future might be a few years further out and that it might be more expensive to develop because we'll be funding this for a bit longer until it gets there. But on the other hand, from our perspective, we're not a company that's traditionally done hardware or built operating systems or these kind of products. So every year that we get to practice and get better and build our brand around Oculus in terms of building the best products that we can in this space, I just think that we're going to be better off when this is really ready to be a completely mainstream thing with hundreds of millions of people using it. You're right that Quest is growing and doing quite well. We are selling them as fast as we can make them, the demand has been strong and the content is starting to pick up both on the AAA, really high quality side and some of the  stuff that I think is quite good.

1743,3057,27958,27958,"Sure well, I mean we do a lot of stuff around commerce. I mean, we have Facebook Marketplace is probably the most advanced and hundreds of millions of people use that to buy and sell things. Instagram Shopping of course a lot earlier. But we're very optimistic about it. But we are optimistic on the timeframe of years, right not driving next quarter's business. And then in terms of payments, there's multiple approaches that we're taking there. We're of course working on payments in WhatsApp. We have our test going in India. It's the test really shows that a lot of people are going to want to use this product. We're very optimistic that we're going to able to launch to everyone in India soon, but of course will share more news when we have that. And we also differentiate between payment systems that are built on top of the existing financial infrastructure like what we're trying to do with WhatsApp payments or when we make payments in Instagram Shopping, and our work with something like Libra that is trying to build some new technological infrastructure for financial services. So they're working on different thing. If Libra works, then it will be able to make certain kind of payments whether they're micropayments or remittances across borders. We'll be able to be done much faster and much more affordably than it can happen today on top of existing rail. So I remain optimistic that we'll be able to do work there, but we're just working across a lot of different fronts here because this is a huge space. It's one of the areas that I am most excited and optimistic about for the years ahead.

1744,3057,24133,24133,"So look, I think some of what you might be asking about are the antitrust questions that are out there in the investigations and I can talk a bit about this, if it's helpful. I mean, look, I think a lot of the antitrust questions that are out there that are going to be about our acquisition of Instagram, right. And some of that -- how that might affect other things that we do today, but -- so there's going to be a lot of scrutiny of that acquisition in particular. And so I think if it's helpful I'll go back to what it was like at the time there when we did that acquisition just to kind of lay out how we were thinking about this. And at the time of course in some way we considered Instagram to be a competitor, but we've always thought that the better way to target -- to think about Instagram was that it's complementary to Facebook and what we're doing. Back in 2012, people generally didn't think of Instagram as competing with our core service. We thought about Instagram in the context of this new mobile camera space that was complementary. If you remember, back then we were building the Facebook camera app. There were lots of different services. There is a camera plus VSCO Cam, Socialcam, Viddy, Snapseed. There were even apps like PAS . They were all in the same space. We thought that mobile photos we're going to be important. So we were competing there with things like Facebook camera, but we ultimately thought that we were going to do better work if we were building with Instagram. But if you remember at the time, Instagram was focused on helping people take photos, apply creative filters and share them publicly across different social networks including Facebook. It wasn't a full featured social network itself. It only had about 30 million people using it at the time. I mean, I remember specifically Kevin and I set a goal that we hope that one day Instagram might reach 100 million people. And I know that that seems quaint today compared to how well it's done. But remember that a lot of the other services that were Instagram's peers and were growing quickly at the time including startups with strong teams and very talented founders like Path don't really even exist today anymore. So look, I mean at the end of the day, the FTC makes its judgment on what we can do, the FTC had all this context when they made this decision in 2012. And the reality is, it ends up being a lot more complementary than I think we ever expected. Look, I mean, building services like this is hard, right. Instagram wouldn't be what it is today without Kevin and Mike who are just really incredible product leaders and of course did a lot of amazing work. But it also wouldn't be what it is without everything that we put into it and whether that's the infrastructure or our advertising model or spam and safety services and a lot more. And I know it can be really hard given how well things have gone to look back and remember what the world was like at the time that we made this acquisition. But our outlook was really different then and the outcome was not all guaranteed. So look, I mean I think for all the concern about whether there is enough competition, the space today continues to be incredibly competitive. We have different competitors in the space today like Snapchat, which shows that people are always building new ideas. And on mobile phones. Of course remember that both Apple and Google has built cameras and private photo sharing and photo management directly into their operating system. So I think that kind of gives you a picture of how we think about some of the scrutiny that's coming and just how we think about doing these things in general.",AID_18,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame
1745,3057,15850,15850,"I think it was about GDPR and how that's gone relative to expectations. We've seen adoptions around people who are opting out of allowing us to use context from the apps. And so I'd say that was largely within the range of expectations that we saw and it is having an impact and the people who are opting out are seeing less relevant ads. And obviously that will impact both, I think, the quality of the experience in terms of the ads they get and also the monetization for us. So I think that is kind of playing out as we expected. CCPA, I think is still a work in progress. So we're watching the developments on that closely. That's the California Consumer Privacy Act, and that has many similar provisions to GDPR, but it's a different line. We're going to have to watch how that evolves, but we do think that that's a factor that we're watching closely and we'll just have to see how that develops.",AID_13,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

1747,3057,20093,20093,"So in terms of the deceleration, we continue to expect deceleration into 2020, but it would be, we believe, more moderated and the reasons for that, that we expect the deceleration. We do continue to see these ad targeting related headwinds, which have been playing out slowly, but we think are still in front of us. The majority of potential signal loss on targeting is still in front of us. And that's the three factors that I cited, the regulatory landscape, potential platform changes and then the adoption of our own products like OFA that we're just rolling out now. So all of those will play into the potential deceleration of revenue growth in 2020. Obviously, we're lapping what's been good performance in 2019 where we've made a lot of product improvements and growing off a large base. So I think we are experiencing deceleration from that perspective.

1748,3057,30889,30889,"All right, so on news, there are two things that I'm quite excited about here. One is just building a dedicated product space for high quality news. And the second is having a business partnership with news publishers that I think can be sustainable over the long term. So I'll talk a bit about both of them and why I think they are important. We'll start with the product, which is if you look at the Facebook app overall, for a lot of years the app was synonymous with News Feed, right, the main tab in the app and of course everyone who uses Facebook pretty much uses News Feed. And one of the questions that we had was, there are of course a lot of things that some people want to do, but not everyone and we weren't sure if we were going to be able to build a secondary tab in the app that could be meaningful even if most people didn't use them. But we started building things like Marketplace, that is a tab that and even if the majority of people on Facebook don't use it, it's still hundreds of millions of people are using it. So that's really, that's really valuable. And we built Watch. We're seeing a similar trend there. It took us a little while to really get it to work the way that we wanted, but now it's growing quickly, that's going to be hundreds of millions of people who are using it. We rolled out Facebook Dating. I don't know if that will be many hundreds of millions of people just because of the size of that market, but it's going be very useful for tens of millions of people around the world, maybe a hundred million or more. And we are of course doing this with groups and there will be opportunities to do this in other places, including with news. So I think in the future if this works out, what we're going to see is that how people use the Facebook app is going to be, they're going to keep on using News Feed, they are going to keep on sharing with friends and family, but the average person will also probably have one, two or three other apps or kind of secondary tabs that they use that are quite useful for them in connecting with their broader community on Facebook. But those things that each individual use, they're going to vary from person to person. So it's not going to be that everyone is using News Feed, they're going to have -- different people are going to care about different things, whether it's community, or marketplace marketplace for some or dating or news for others. And surely even though not everyone comes to Facebook, because they want high quality news , I believe that there are going to be, whether it's 10% or 20% at a floor who I think would really want something like this. And, we're going to work with the news publishers to make this very valuable and I'm optimistic that we can get there. So that's the kind of the product strategy on the Facebook side. Produce publishers, the thing that I'm excited about is, look, I do think that we have a responsibility to help work with newest publishers to fund high quality journalism. It's no secret that the Internet has disrupted the business model for journalism. And I think that that means that the major Internet platforms have a responsibility to form partnerships and help to fund this work. And the challenge that we've had historically. Is that when most of the usage of the Act was a News Feed. What our community told us is that they really wanted more content from friends and family and less other stuff, right. So less public video is less of other content besides friends and family. So even though we were talking to a lot of news publishers and we wanted to find a way to support and they of course wanted more distribution and some kind of financial relationship. It didn't really make a lot of sense in the past to pay for content to that a lot of our community was generally telling us that they want to see other stuff instead of that. But now with the dedicated news tab. We finally have a space where the business model forward really works for us to be in a long-term sustainable financial relationship with news publishers, where we can pay them for high quality content that can go in there that will be what would fuels the tab. It makes it a great product. And I think in doing so. This can be a long-term virtuous cycle and sustainable business model in way that we can help support journalism.

I don't think we have any new status to share on this, but I mean overall we rolled out the tab for -- almost the first year we were really tuning it just to make sure that it would be retentive and very valuable for people. So they are in general -- the way we think about this stuff is, we try not to put something in front of a lot of people unless we're confident that they're going to find it useful and want to come back and use it multiple times and we can put a lot of things in front of people not to try it once, but we want to wait until things are kind of retentive and useful. So we got to there on Watch, it's growing well and that is -- so we're kind of still now focused on continuing to make it better and continuing to grow it. The premium content part of it, yes, I think the right way to think about this is almost as marketing to help people try out the tab for the first time. There are some good tent pole pieces of content that people really love that they come and they check out the product to experience that and then they stay for a lot of the other valuable content that's in there and that might not be talked about as much in the news.

In general what we have to do is we use computers and AI for what they're good for which is looking at a lot of content very quickly and making quick judgments. And we have teams of people doing what people are good for which is making nuanced human judgments. And so you build the computer system, in that way they can flag and get rid of some of the worst stuff, and so they can flag for human review, some of the stuff that's borderline and then there's just so much content flowing through the system that we do need a lot of people looking at this. And I don't think that's going to change anytime soon.Dave Wehner: And Heather, I would add that when you're using systems to look at content, when you're using AI machine learning systems, it's a real benefit to have actual people looking and tagging that content, classifying it because it helps those machine learning algorithms be able to learn what they're looking at. So you actually have -- we do have actually ramped in people who are doing the tagging and classification. So there is actually expense related to AI that's on the human side in the near-and medium-term as well. So very much in line with what Mark said.

And then in addition, in Q4, and over the longer term, we do continue to expect to face ad targeting related headwinds and uncertainties. And I just go back to the three factors that I cited in the past that the regulatory landscape is continuing to evolve. So for example, when GDPR came into effect, we saw a number of people who opted out on allowing us to use context from the apps and websites they visited for ad targeting. And then the second factor is just we're seeing proposed changes from the mobile platforms that are more oriented towards privacy which could affect targeting and measurement and make that more difficult. And then finally, we are rolling out our own product changes such as the recent launch of OSA that's our user control on what data stored on Facebook activity.

We are planning to reaccelerate or accelerate hiring in 2020 and that's really going to be focused on the important priorities of the Company.

That includes building products around Facebook and Instagram and continuing to improve those but also in new developing areas like AR/VR. So those are big factors in growth.

1767,3057,9330,9330,"In terms of monetization opportunities, I can speak to that and Mark can add color if you would like. Obviously -- and Sheryl would like to add color as well. So, Stories is obviously one of the big growing areas for us and continues to be a big driver. We're also seeing opportunities around Instagram Explore going into 2020. We're now monetizing with that product and more advertisers are buying from it and then Sheryl is going to jump in and I think give some additional color.Sheryl Sandberg: Yes, I think in terms of our core advertising products and growth, it's worth really remembering that our core feed products for Facebook and Instagram are growing nicely and well. And we see a lot of opportunity to continue that growth. Definitely, Stories is a big part of the success. We've had I think a lot of success moving advertisers to where people already are. That's what happened with mobile ads. People weren't really doing mobile ads and we helped them get there. I think we've taken our experience on how to help advertisers migrate to the right places and been able to do that even more quickly in new formats like Stories. So of our more than 7 million advertisers, we already have 3 million advertising across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger Stories. And I think that's because we learned that we have to do a lot to help them move. So for example, advertisers can now buy Stories across Facebook, Instagram and Messenger all at once. We had automatic default templates which convert your feed ads into vertical Stories format and this quarter we just launched customizable templates, which help you save time and resources. So as we have to help advertisers move, we've learned how to make those investments in making the formats really easy, the measurement really easy, the buying really easy. Now, the mix to Stories is a big opportunity for us. Stories still does monetize at the same rate as a News Feed right now. So, we're keeping an eye on that. But the growth over the long run is pretty exciting.

So it's a bunch of different factors and I think we're seeing good engagement from a bunch of cohorts in the US, which is good. But of course we are highly penetrated in the US and Canada.

1784,3059,6918,6919, The -- I'll take the last one first. We do have a SiriusXM for Business. It's relatively small. It's one that -- frankly we're right in the middle of our business planning process now and we continue to really look at how we might be able to amplify it. There's not an obvious path to do that.We're kind of happy with where it is right now and I would expect it'll just kind of grows. It's low growth. It is a good product. We continue to look for opportunities there. But it's one that -- we've even looked at acquisition opportunities. It's just not obvious that I've seen anything that's impressed me. But it is a good little business for us.,AID_7,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame
1785,3059,23820,23820,So yes so we're really hopeful that the last time the Sirius platform didn't die for a really long time. But maybe I can answer it in 2 different ways. The Sirius fleet the low-band fleet is already at its peak in the field right that there are -- most of the current production is actually on the XM chipset and so the Sirius fleet has sort of reached its peak and will begin to work its way down. There are a lot of active revenue-generating subscribers on the Sirius platform.And we expect that to remain the case for probably another solid 6 7 years. I think the last of the OEMs to leave the Sirius platform from a new production perspective is just maybe 1 year to 2 years away and there is a real big drop in production on the Sirius platform in the course of that sort of the next year. And I just can't remember if we have a straggler in '21 production or '22 production.There's a little bit in there. But the way you can think about it is in terms of when would we enter the window of considering changing the content and giving people with Sirius radios effectively and XM Radio and change the content on that satellite that's again probably a good 6 7 years away.,AID_14,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1786,3059,18809,18810, In terms of the auto deals I guess I'll start with -- I think without sounding arrogant I don't want us to sound -- I think we understand as well or better than anybody what the entertainment and infotainment landscape looks like in the vehicle for many years to come. And so we're well aware of the deals you referenced with Google and others.By the way our -- the deal with Google in that particular pace is for what Google is calling GAS Google audio -- Android systems. And I think Google has decided on a strategy. That strategy quite candidly at least in my opinion doesn't conflict in any way with our strategy. And so -- and by the way it's quite nice for the automakers. It helps them both innovate faster and offload frankly a lot of their -- and the recalls that they've been spending for years to get their tier 2s to move with them along their development.So I get why they're doing that. We are acutely aware of what these things are that are happening in the transition of technology. I think what you should assume what's really important to us and where the deals I think have changed from the ones that we did 10 years ago and 5 years ago is we're not just asking for penetration commitments we're also very aware that where you're placed on the screen and how the customer finds your service in the vehicle is crucial.And so that's why the 360L part is so important. It's not just about 360L yes. It's -- we want that to be the primary screen where the consumer gets our service so the experience is the best and very early on. Because I can tell you these screens are going to get quite complicated.And so yes the deals have changed to where it's not just penetration it's prominence and placement as well.

1794,3059,764,765, I know we've had 360L product for quite a bit out there. We're beginning to see the conversion of the very first generation of that. It's a very small quantity. So James honestly I don't -- I haven't reached any conclusion that's meaningful for you. We are seeing significant now buildup in 360L as we announced last quarter with GM beginning to deploy.And so I would expect to get more visibility and first question a much bigger base kind of late spring early summer next year that we can probably see. In terms of color on 360L the color is the same as I've always said. And our announcement with Nissan today is just - the beat goes on one more. 360L will continue to steadily roll out with every single one of our partners over the next 5 years to where it ultimately is every single one of our cars.And so we're really pleased with how it's going.

1795,3059,4216,4217, I think it was up around 19% on the subscription side excluding connected vehicle this quarter. I think there's still some MRF rolling through there. So can you just talk about how we should think about subscription ARPU for the medium term? Does it revert kind of back to inflationary rates? Or do you still like the pricing power here? And just relatedly on the ad side it seems like that grows to mid- to high single digit all the time. So is the SiriusXM ad ARPU also a continued growth driver?,QID_4,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
1796,3059,14198,14199, And just one other point on that. As the content comes in our ad sales monetization skills as Jim and David referred to with both Sirius and Pandora are making a huge difference compared to years ago in monetizing the new content and the old content.,AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1797,3059,9726,9726,"Just two quick things. One on the -- I obviously agree with what Jim said. Our strategy at Pandora and Sirius on podcasting is no different than any of our other content strategies. We want to find the best content that will truly make a difference and also act as a fuse to have our listeners find other content. So that will continue.The fact that a lot of big names, many big names, both individual and brands are in the business is the opportunity that we're most excited about. Given that most podcasts are put out for free on an RSS feed Pandora quietly has accumulated -- approaching 7000 very good podcasts already. So that on virtually or no or limited economics the tonnage will be there like everybody else.The [Marvels] [ph] and others will make a difference. The other point is once Pandora -- and it's not a question of if it's when. Once Pandora's algorithm is able to align your music pace with your podcast and you can surface podcasts the way they surface music it's an entire different game because as the music industry learns soon enough the issue is whether you can curate well and surface well when there's a tremendous amount out there.And we think we'll be in that game as well as the quality game. And obviously as David and orders touched on the ad monetization potential podcast on and off-platform we think we're well suited for it.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1798,3059,20747,20748, The -- it's one of -- we're giving guidance on net adds right? And we have a huge funnel for the growth side. And as Jim mentioned before we got a large subscriber base business. And a few basis points difference in churn produces a big impact too.So it's one of these things where we are very cautious about the net add guidance we gave because it only takes -- if each of those things go just a tiny bit the wrong way it has an outside impact on net adds. And if they go the right way it also has an outsized impact in net adds it's just that that one's more fun than the former.So look it's nothing more than -- we're very looking at the rest of the year. We are confident of making the $1 million. And we'll see what happens in the next 60 days.,AID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1799,3059,3571,3571,And the only thing I would add is David said -- there is a lot of competition -- a lot of good competition out there which we respect. But we think we have a game plan James to deal with this and we'll keep at it.,AID_1,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame
1800,3059,17026,17027, So Ben a couple of quick things. One yes it was obviously competition. Why wouldn't it be? Every field they've ever [entered] of media they've made a difference. And audio is sort of the last field I think that they're not in a significant way and now they are. So that was good. And the factor with Marvel and the NFL which I don't want to get lost sight on this is there's a lot of digital audio players that are largely algorithmically driven.Marvel's single biggest factor and they referred to it with SiriusXM's long history of audio production and the quality of that was the same factor with the NFL coming here. So we're excited about that.And obviously since the Marvel announcement it has led to other high-quality brands being interested and we're looking at those judiciously but it's nice to have the opportunity to have them come in to look at.,AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1801,3059,452,452,Secondly on the Sirius side any incremental color on 360L in particular? What conversion rate you're seeing versus vehicle -- comparable vehicles with standard radios operating expense impact et cetera?,QID_2,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
1802,3059,12152,12152,Well I think we'll have more say about that in -- around the consumer electronics -- around early -- in early January.,AID_8,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1803,3059,20657,20657,I want to say our guidance is our guidance.,AID_12,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

1805,3059,6511,6511,And I guess the third and final one is we sort of noticed that Sirius for Business [indiscernible] for the restaurant. And you don't really talk about that very much.

1806,3059,22410,22410,Can you remind us when the last car that's tuned to the Sirius satellite will sort of die and sort of free up those 2 satellites to pursue something new?,QID_14,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_attack
1807,3059,4898,4899, So on the subscription ARPU I mean we've been saying this for a long time that rather than look at any particular quarter and sort of how it looks I think the better thing is to kind of take a step back and look at what we've done over the course of the last 8 - 9 years.And what you see while there's a couple of spikes in it averages out to about 2.5% of inflation and the underlying prices per year. And we think that's probably a good place to stay.,AID_4,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1808,3059,11100,11100, So in the level of investment Jessica we don't expect the investments in podcast to really alter the way we invest per dollar revenue. And -- though we will monetize the podcast so there's enhanced monetization. You talked about definition of success. Audience engagement is something that we're going to be looking at. And so yes I don't think you should think of the investments in podcast. It's fundamentally changing the economic trends of the business.,AID_5,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1809,3059,21511,21511,Yes. And I just -- I'll add just one more color because it goes exactly into David's point of -- one that quite honestly I don't know what it's going to mean in the next 60 days. I know what it means -- it doesn't mean anything midterm. But GM announced 2 days ago that they missed production on 300000 vehicles while they were on strike.Those 300000 vehicles got to work their way through trial funnels and be rebuilt. We don't know what the timing of that is. We don't know whether there was a miss at retail while those -- while that strike went on.We'll get far more visibility on that first question over the next 4 to 6 weeks. We factor that into our thinking and -- but that's just one element of why I think our guidance is far more sophisticated than you might think.,AID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1810,3059,7564,7564,"Going back to podcasting I would say first and foremost the word I've used with our team is discipline first and foremost. We're taking a very disciplined approach to this. I think there are 2 sides to success -- there's actually 3 sides of success in podcasting in my mind. First and foremost is building a very robust structure. And by that I mean technical structure that can support that business in the way we think it needs to be supported including with the ad technology that we think is necessary to tailor the ads and a lot of those things. Our teams are working right now on what we believe is a solid road map to do that.That road map may involve us doing some small things with some outside partners. I don't know yet or we may do it all ourselves. But I would expect to have more visibility to that here first question in the first half of next year. But I will tell you that's not an earth-shattering kind of investment. It is work and we just got to keep it right and get it right.

And the management of churn obviously I believe is -- as key indicator of anything and how the business -- how a large subscription business is running.We're really pleased with where we are. Frankly almost everything we're doing in terms of adding value and -- like things like making streaming available to virtually all -- most of our subscribers at no charge are aimed at the initiative of improving churn.We know the more people listen the less likely they are to churn. So we're putting all those things together. I have -- it first question is my premise that that can help but it -- but help churn. There is a force going the other way which is vehicle turnover continue -- as the fleet gets bigger the percent of our churn that becomes a vehicle turnover gets higher.And so really what you need to look for that offset is more in the used car growth as opposed to in the churn number. So we're really focused on this. I think we're probably comfortable with what we've said. We are comfortable with what we've said on churn.I'm not ready to lower that and first question as to what ranges we think about.

You got to fight hard against a lot of competitors every day to sort of keep your book of business.And so we're not looking to just sort of jack the prices.

And so to some degree that exists today, my perspective is that we will grow in the future to larger numbers that will grow disproportionately.And one of the things we are doing is trying to make it simpler and simpler for people to get on these sort of monthly financing kind of things.

Third, the things that we've done from a pricing and monthly payments point of view and trade-in, getting the trade-in program up and running, all of these things have had moved the dial.

1857,3061,8997,8997,"Let me just start off explaining what the franchise agreement is. At its most basic level, it's an agreement that sets for the procedures for us to use city right away for our infrastructure and the fee schedule that we pay in order to use their right away. So what I'm talking about here that are kind of granular things that are in the franchise agreement is, how many times could you open up a street to interconnect a new business, what the fees are for those operations that kind of granular detail. We've been in negotiations with the city now for some time. There was a pause in those negotiations while the mayor's race was being sorted out and her new team was put in place, I'm pleased with the progress we're making right now.There are three potential outcomes here. The agreement that is scheduled to come to an end at the end of next calendar year, at the end of 2020. Either party ComEd or the city have an option at the end of this year to terminate the agreement or they could continue to negotiate. As I said the path we're on right now is that we're continuing to negotiate and if we're successful we'll will get a new agreement. If the city elects to terminate at the end of this year, we will continue negotiations and if we do not reach a resolution. It's not like we stop providing electric service to the city but our fee schedule and our procedures will drop out of the franchise agreement and will be governed by the municipal code that'll add a little bit of process to our work, but it doesn't shut down quite obviously our activities. If the city does not issue a notice of termination at the end of the year and we continue to negotiate and can't reach a resolution. Then the agreement by its terms just continues year-to-year until we reach a resolution.So that's kind of the outline of it. And Julien, if you don't mind, I'd like to provide some additional context Chris and Greg talked a little bit about our performance, but I think it bears on the entire discussion this morning. We are on track at ComEd to deliver our best performance in the history of the company. We talk about being first quartile. We're actually first decile in reliability and arguably best in class. As a result of the good policies, which we've advocated for, 92% of the energy that we deliver to customers comes from zero carbon resources. To put that into context, the next closest large utility is at about 46%. We have a supplier diversity program that is second to none. 41% of our spend this year is with businesses owned by women and people of color as well as veterans.We are on track as a result of all of this to deliver the best customer satisfaction we've ever seen. And we're doing all of it at affordable rates. Today, our rates are 20% lower than the average for large American cities. Four out of nine of our rate cases have been decreases under the smart grid law, including the last two cases. Chris talked about the investigation and first question, we'll have learnings as a consequence of it. But it's important for all of the shareholders who invest in our platform to understand that we are doing a lot of things, right. And with some humility could lay claim to being one of the best performing utilities in America.

The conversations, negotiations, strategy for the legislation is still an active conversation with many stakeholders.

And to speak as a body, as somebody did to one publication, we're still very close in conversation with some of those members of the coalition and we'll continue, but there is a lot of people involved, there is different coalitions, there's the path to one hundred to the clean jobs coalition. There is the labor. So things are continuing to evolve in conversations with leadership and the legislature are continuing to take place. So it's not like we're stalled or stopped or don't have parties to deal with. Kathleen is doing -- for the Generation side doing a significant part of that. And Joe is working to not only support what the Governor wants and what the State wants, but in the meantime, also protecting the consumers to make sure what we're doing to get to the path to a 100% clean by 2030 is done in a most economic fashion. I'll Kathleen if she wants to add anything more to the first part and I'm going to turn it over to Joe.\n\nKathleen Barron: The only thing that I would add is that the same news story is talking about that question, Julien. I also mentioned that the FRR is the center piece of this CJC bill. And that's because it's essential to achieving the state's clean energy goals. If we do not address this, the PJM market will send over $1 billion a year to old coal plants rather than investing the money toward the state's clean energy ambition, and that the fact that folks are lobbying and rallying in the capital around this. The fact that it's an important policy change and that it needs to happen right away is something that should be noted.Now obviously there are other elements of the bill both from the CJC, the path to 100 others that there is not agreement about and that's why it's going to take all stakeholders together to deliver piece of legislation that will get the states to its clean energy goals in a way that's affordable and we are committed, as Chris said, to working with all stakeholders to achieve that goal.",AID_5,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

And so we have discussed openly that there -- the four sites are in the future at current forwards with the current capacity market being managed the way it is by PJM versus the needs that the state wants to maintain the clean energy sources with lack of being able to get legislation to change and be able to pull ourselves out of a very inefficient by what the state wants auction process at PJM and go into FRR. They're marginal at best to looking forward to losing cash and earnings.So that's the situation. Now, I don't think we're announcing the amounts yet.

The capex plan, as we've said, only corporates identified projects that benefit the consumer and improve the liability in the customer experience.

So just wanted to understand how we should think about the generation business, it seems like curves itself aren't enough volatility is now a new element that we need to consider. How should we think about the stability of the generation business?

Obviously, the power markets have some challenges and you've seen what we done -- we've done with our new business, we continue to work hard to find ways to reduce the cost structure both from an O&M and capital investment perspective of our generation assets as well as our Constellation business. And I think that's -- what you'll see us continue to do. I think the second piece of that gets into the industrial strategy of what we're trying to accomplish as a company. You see how we're investing in our utilities, you see how we continue to manage our balance sheet and we continue to return value to the shareholders. That is being done on the back of cash flows that are being generated -- free cash flow that's being generated at Exelon Generation and we will continue to work hard to do that as we continue to transform the Generation business.So last piece is obviously, as we've talked about in our prepared remarks and with some of the questions, we announced this cost cutting exercising business as usual state, depending on the outcome of the legislation in Illinois, clearly there is other elements to our business that would need to evolve under certain scenarios, so we'll continue to work hard at that and then that'll be dictated by other outcomes.\n\nKen Cornew: Hey, Praful, it's Ken Cornew. I'll just add a comment. We can -- our strategy continues to be a premier operator of generation particularly nuclear and other clean generation and also be a solutions provider for customers that has not changed. I wouldn't think about the Generation company any differently than that. And I'd like Jim to comment a little more on the customer side of our business.\n\nJim McHugh: Yeah, so I think it's important to note that the new business generation -- we put new business targets in our hedge disclosures, that's an expectation of the value we're going to create both from our customer-facing businesses as well as the optimization of the assets in the markets. The customer-facing businesses are performing very strongly and the stable value that has been there for a while, we still see good margins in really product enhancements and product solutions for customers who are demanding more. What's happening on our wholesale business side is the lower volatility in the markets which actually where we've reduced our new business targets around that end of the business, which actually, in my view point, leads to more stability. We have an environment where 70% to 75% of the gross margin in our new business will come from the stable customer-facing businesses that we run that are still performing strongly.So a smaller portion of our overall gross margins would come from this optimization activity. We happen to have an expectation of those numbers in our forward disclosures and that's the number that we are lowering based on this environment where we just see the supply stack being strong in markets like PJM and policy adding more generations to the stack, low natural gas price volatility and low demand growth in markets like PJM. So I think we're able to shift our business focus here to this customer-facing business that's more stable. We can reduce our costs to match that new business model and really provide an environment that I think is a less risk environment for the Generation company.",AID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

1876,3061,12540,12540,"So I guess one of the things that we struggle with these disclosures has just been really what benefit if any you've gotten from legislation over the last few years. And for example on the formula rates, the ROE right now is actually really low and, as Joe mentioned. And then also, I guess, you've gotten the ZECs on Clin and Quad. So just but I think those plants would have been losing a lot of money if you didn't get them. So I guess, maybe you could just give some color of kind of what value really is at risk from this from an investor standpoint because it's just not clear that you've gotten a lot of value out of any legislation over this period?",QID_7,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_attack
1877,3061,13211,13211,"Well, we -- the value is the consistency in the process of the rate cases. We are tied to the 30-year and that was a negotiation that was done. If you look at the history of the rate cases and how it has improved the regulatory process and the consistency of the regulatory process, I think there's a lot of value in that. When you get 100% of ask or 99.6% of ask and you're not litigating something over an extended period, it creates predictability. We can't control the 30-year, but we can control the efficiency and the productivity of the system with the right regulatory format and that's what we've done. As for Clinton and Quad cities it did save the plants and it's more than just saving losing cash, we would have shut them down and that issue would have been resolved very quickly. It's meaningful to state in the community but it also is providing a profitable cash flow from those units.We're working on legislation that would either secure on the other four sites in the state through the FRR process or we will shut those plants down. So -- in a point in time with the low interest rate, you could point to that and say we haven't got anything, but that is not been the historical case, and going forward, we'll watch what we can do if interest rates persist to stay low what action we should take. But I would have to tell you that, I understand the sentiment of your view or your question but there has been a great deal of consistency that's happened and a great deal of ability to invest capital. It's more than just the ROE, right. We have been able to through legislative terms -- been able to consistently invest needed capital for reliability and efficiency and be able to earn a return. They may be a little bit lower returns but we're able to predictably invest the money and predictably get a return on the money.So that's huge, if you go back historically to what's happened in some of our jurisdictions investing money at risk and then getting the disallowances in the regulatory process was much more damning than having a low 30-year rate and having a low ROE , but still an ROE that's above our cost of capital.",AID_7,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

1881,3062,45094,45094,"And Keith, with regards to the second question, yes, of course, it didn't go unnoticed with us as well, but we're delighted to have beaten consensus and indeed our guidance for this quarter. But bear in mind, we had set guidance prudently and we're also walking into the coming quarter having read the dynamics in the industry. So we remained somewhat I would say prudent going into this quarter as well. The backdrop is uncertain.However, I would say, if I look at the micro element within Cognizant. First of all, growth is permeating the company. We're going back to our roots, is back to basics and I think people are actually delighted with that. We found appreciation of focusing on growth as opposed to margin rate. We have very deliberately insisted on a significant uptake in executive presence with customers, I'm leading by example myself. And that permeates the organization as well. And then of course, Karen and I have been working on what we announced today for a number of months now.And so we've been trying to start looking at deals, not with today's cost structure but envisaging the economic value of deals over time with tomorrow's cost structure, which as you know, we're aiming to reduce and we know in Cognizant that once we get our foot in the door with clients, because we have confidence in our teams and confidence in our delivery, we tend to land and expand. And hence that’s also the reason we're deploying the RAD model going forward to make sure we accelerate new logos and cross sell and upsell.So, those are the positives, but again, the backdrop is uncertain. Certainly in the UK it's an uncertain, I would say in North America, what we found is there is continued compression in legacy businesses and pricing pressure under renewals continues at a steady rate, but the digital imperatives remain key.I've been pleasantly surprised as I've dealt with C-suite executives throughout the world, that digital is first question not viewed as a cost center expense. It is very much viewed as a critical enabler both on the defense as well as on the offense for these companies to disrupt or indeed to avoid being disrupted by more nimble next generation companies. And that is an area where on the contrary I do not see demand constraints. I see more supply constraints given the nature of the teams we need to fulfill those demands.",AID_4,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame
1882,3062,51609,51609,"Yes. So, hi rod. It's a good question and look, if I look back over the last four years and the data will tell you that we have been growing new logos but not really accelerating new logo revenue and really the pipeline and the TCV in the last 18 months or so, stop this year performing where we needed it to be. But the bigger issue was to your point, the install base accounts and we had stopped mining or upselling and on the contrary because of pricing erosion at the time of renewals that became a little bit of a drag on the business.So very much at the core of the RAD model is of course hearing customers, make some potential, not based on where we are today. And of course segmenting customers than between acquisition customers versus a customer that you already exist in that you want to develop or where you already exist that you're simply trying to retain.So the RAD model was key to achieving this. Sales compensation is also key because in our existing accounts, what we want to do is get much more leverage in the sales compensation program and put parameters into portion of people's compensation such that they are not just enticed but they're also obligated from their earnings point of view to cross-sell the portfolio into digital and beyond as opposed to simply selling what they sold yesterday, which has traditionally been a path of least resistance.And then the third thing of course, as we're thinking about upselling and cross selling, a lot of that leads to different decision makers. It's more project based, it's more pod cultures in digital engineering. It's line of service. So, distinctively changing out some client partners, we've done a good job on that in some of the accounts I've seen for us in the last few months.These are client partners that joined Cognizant in the last year or so, or 18 months, a different background, a different compensation model. But again, I don't think about the salary of a salesperson as a cost. I think about it as an investment and therefore I think about it in terms of sales gearing both on a gross margin level versus OpEx or indeed on revenue basis versus OpEx.And then last but not least, we were really trying to segment our own capabilities into a four box great sellers who understand the industry and understand the technology is in the top right hand quadrant. You also have a bunch of people who are very competent with technology but not really sellers. Some of those you can migrate across to more commercial skills. Some of them will simply remain presales types oriented, presales oriented people.Some people are frankly great sellers but don't really understand the industry well enough or the customer pain points. We obviously have to educate them and then the people in the bottom left that are the worst of both worlds, not particularly good commercial skills in terms of getting a PO signed but first question not technical either. Those are the people that most likely you'll see exit the company going forward, particularly in a sales comp plan where with a higher variable portion of compensation they will not be earning as much as they have been previously.And then one of the final actions we've taken to ensure cross selling is to put all of these so-called CSE's. These are our more specialists salespeople aligned into the practice and service lines to ensure a great deal of focus on competency assessments, certifications, and then need alignment with our partners that intersect nonetheless with verticals to make sure we have the right skill sets and indeed the right go to market partnerships to do QBR with more of our partners and make sure we end up with asymmetrical accounts where clients can, our partners can bring us into their accounts and vice versa.

1883,3062,47643,47643,"I want to start by asking if you could provide maybe a framework for how investors should think of the trajectory of growth over the next couple of years as these initiatives unfold. I mean, will we see perhaps a flattish type pace before higher growth kicks in. And that's I guess including the impact of the CMT the content ops. And then in the meantime, what are your thoughts on providing metrics to the investor community that help us if you are on the right track?",QID_5,Question_1_Market_related,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
1884,3062,33972,33972,"So I'll give you four examples. First of all, it's important to clarify to roll up the client partner and returning to two-in-a-box, I think really simplifies Cognizant's go-to-market team in front of the customer. So we traditionally used to have two-in-a-box of client partner and delivery partner. A few years ago, we moved to three-in-a-box and we were returning to what we traditionally have had with greater clarity of roles and responsibilities.Therefore, between the client partner and the new role that we will term an engagement delivery partner. Second point, we will actually add more headcount in sales or the commercial function than before. I've referenced this in our prior call. We are adding approximately 500 headcounts. Not all of those are quota carrying, but some for instance will be business finance people or indeed commercial lawyers, but it's all with a view to helping us show up to more clients and have greater agility and for the clients with greater responsibility.The third major thing relates to how we want to compensate our commercial teams. As of January 1, we will move to a more leveraged sales compensation plan with at least 70% of the base fixed or at most and then 30% variable. And within the variable portion of their compensation, there will be strict parameters in terms of what they are required to sell that will enable us to ensure that people do not follow the path of least resistance, which is what they sold yesterday, but more readily embraced the things that we need them to sell, which is part of our digital strategy.And then the fourth thing we will deploy something we spend a lot of time working on the last four months, what I call a RAD model. That is a term to address how you think about sales segmentation in the purest form, how you tier customers, Tier 1, 2 and 3 based not just on what you sell them today but more readily on what you have the potential to sell them on.So potential versus current and then you tier customers between an existing customer or that you want to retain or potentially develop subject to your share of wallet or a customer that you want to acquire. And according to where a customer sits in that nine box, then the degree of sales coverage that they get or visits from somebody like myself changes.So those are four examples of what we're doing to try to ramp our commercial momentum. Obviously in addition to that, I've talked previously about greater alignment with strategic partners. I referenced in today's script the notion of going to market more readily with hyperscale players, but we have some tremendous partners in industry verticals like Temenos, Guidewire, Adobe and the like that we want to embrace further and make sure we go-to-market with together.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

I think we think that perhaps those are areas that we've under invested in recently and so those will become part of the core of the organization going forward.

1889,3062,37272,37272,"That's inherently a complex topic because we have a series of activities that we have from time and materials staff augmentation through to managed services or more fixed price type bids. But let me decompose your question down and Karen, perhaps you can comment as well on this.With regards to the sales teams, their ability to ramp ultimately also depends on where they've come from before and if they know the client itself or if they know the industry. Our intent is of course to hire people who are able to sell business outcomes, who have the gravitas and the wherewithal to speak with the C-suites, understand the industry pain points and sell a business outcome.So you need to expect them to last. However, as we deploy these salespeople and for the clients, they build relationships subsequently build a pipeline, the pipeline is ultimately progress and eventually turns into TCV, which later turns into revenue. For that reason that we spoken previously around the impact of these 500 headcount that we've agreed to hire, it's more a negative impact in terms of our cost structure into short-term.However, I don't view it as a cost. I viewed as a investment that will have an appropriate return over time in the form of sales force gearing. So OpEx to gross margin dollars or indeed OpEx to revenue dollars and we are anticipating the revenue return from that to really kick in more in Q4 next year or indeed the first half of FY2021.Look, the pricing dynamics are important. Karen can comment on those. I just wanted to add one point. If the client partner is the quarterback on a deal, they need to be surrounded with world-class experts that are aligned to a key practices and have competencies in those areas, whether that is artificial intelligence or analytics or digital engineering or cloud or otherwise.We spend a great deal of time in recent months honing in on the model that we think will give us greater competency and greater technical capability to support a generalist client partner in front of the client. We do want to allocate more pricing power back to the client partner, but they will have to operate within certain bands or parameters as the deals are pricing on a quarterly basis. We will review those, that it will be some notions of checks and balances.Karen McLoughlin: Sure. And so let me talk about a couple of things in pricing. One is what I would call market bill rates and pricing for new deals and renewals and so forth. If you look at the digital business, pricing continues to be very strong there. Obviously, you have a high demand in that business and the short supply of talent. So by definition bill rates continued to be strong there, where you do continue to see pressure on deals and particularly with renewals and vendor consolidations and so forth.It's in the core part of the business, the heritage application maintenance, et cetera, part of the business where we do continue to see pricing pressure on those transactions. The other piece which we are referring to in the script is also around, what I would call contract hygiene. So the ability to get COLA increases, to get rolling changes when we promote people.As you know for several years that was something that just was not commonly done in the industry. And it's something that many firms have started to reinitiate into their portfolio over the last few years. We've made some progress this year where we have automated COLA adjustments and so forth, but I think we still have a lot of opportunity to continue to get better at that and enforcing contract terms. And in particular, when we promote people to either rotate them into new opportunities that are appropriate for their new level or to get rate adjustments within their existing clients, so both of those are opportunities that we continue to see as we move forward.",AID_2,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame
1890,3062,48132,48132,"So Ashwin in terms of growth, I think obviously, it's early to give guidance for next year although first question we would expect that we will start to see some acceleration over versus constant currency organic growth this year. Q4 is obviously a little bit light and Q1 does tend to be a slower quarter for us. So when we give guidance in February, we'll have a little bit more color on how we see the rest of the year playing out in terms of incremental revenue from the sales hires and so forth.We I think as we had talked about this before, we do not anticipate any significant revenue next year from that investment. It really takes about 12 months for the sales teams to ramp-up and actually generate a revenue that becomes incremental to us. So I think that would be more back ended and first question into 2021.

1891,3062,55945,55945,"So I think in banking and healthcare we have some tremendous examples actually and I've seen some of these myself have accounts that we have really turned around in the last two years through different account teams, much more focused on digital. But that's a blueprint or a qualification that we need to bring more broadly across the company. You will see some inflection points, particularly in healthcare as we get into FY20, because we will be rounding the tougher compares.As you know, many of our healthcare clients for in particular merged into two and ended up with a very different rate dynamic for Cognizant. And we will be running that once we get to Q1 next year. In banking it's less obvious in the sense there wasn't a single inflection point or ongoing trends, some captives, some insourcing, particularly in a world of DevOps.But as I said earlier, well the legacy business or traditional areas of the business have been under some pressure of price renewals. I do see opportunity for us to better participate in a digital spend that these banks have at their disposal and have been prioritizing and that's what we're setting out to achieve in the coming years, of course.So no major inflection point, but I will say I am pleased with the revised energy I'm seeing in the North America team now in particular and the new banking leader and a new healthcare leader they seem to be going down well with clients. And that's always a good positive leading indicator.With regards to the content moderation business that's something we're working with our partners on right now to understand how to best transition the work. Whether it is one of the options or reference or another, we will determine that in the coming periods. For now, we've taken a restructuring charge against it, but our intention is to work very aggressively with partners to make sure that we can transition our employees with minimal disruption.

1898,3063,4828,4828,"I'll take the Trikafta question and then Reshma will talk to AAT. So in terms of Trikafta, obviously we were thrilled to get the approval so quickly, as you know the label is broad anybody with one F508del mutation, that's approximately 18,000 patients here in the US. Of those 18,000, about 6,000 are patients, who have a minimal function mutation on the other allele and as you well know, those are the patients who don't currently have a medicine to treat the underlying cause of their disease today. In terms of uptake, again, this is going to be governed by a couple of things, one is the absolute capacity at CF centers. This is by far and away the largest number of eligible patients we've ever had for any new product launch. For instance, more than twice as big as we had when we introduced Orkambi back in July 2015. So clearly, the capacity of centers is going to be a challenge. In terms of prioritizing patients, Mike, we've heard just about everything from every different center and I think if you talk to one center, you'll get response. If you talk to another, you'll get another, some have said that they will prioritize het/min's, some have said that they will treat the most severely impacted patients irrespective of what their mutation is, others have said they were going to treat patients as they are coming in.So I'd love to tell you there's one answer to how patients are going to be treated, but I think it's as individual as individual centers. What I can tell you though is to a center; they will tell you that they expect to treat the vast majority of those minimal function patients over time and indeed expect the vast majority of those who are currently being treated with Symdeko and Orkambi also to transition over time.

1902,3063,12074,12074,"And Alethia, on expectations for England, I really go back to kind of what I said earlier about uptake in all markets. As you said, there's about 5,000 eligible patients in England for the various medicines and across the various age ranges and genotypes that are included in the agreement we struck with the NHS. If you look at the uptake rates around the world for those products across patients and genotypes and age ranges, it's as I said in the 80% to 90% range in terms of how many of those patients have been initiated in similar markets around the world. Again, not every patient can stay on the medicine, the persistence rates again are somewhere in the 80% to 90% range. So if you factor those two things and I think about where might we be when we get to kind of steady state, then that could be somewhere around 3,500 patients could be persistent on a CFTR modulator, if you just take those assumptions and kind of pick the mid-range of all of those other markets around the world.In terms of warehousing that in something that we've heard discussed in the UK. Obviously there has been a lot of pent-up demand for these products. And so we've heard about people wanting to be initiated.

The reason for that is a couple fold, one that it will allow us to collect additional long-term data, as we are currently in the US through our open-label extension studies and we know how important that long-term data is in terms of demonstrating the benefit of CFTR modulators, we've seen that with Kalydeco, we've seen that with Orkambi, and now Symkevi. The more data we get, the more you get to see the long-term benefits that these types of agents have.The second reason why that timing, we think is an appropriate time to be submitting is the NICE is currently undergoing a review of its methodology. As you may know, and as we've made quite public, we have some concerns about the approach that NICE takes to evaluating medicines in terms of their ability to truly value, appropriately medicines like ours that have the kinds of long-term benefits that ours have and we're hopeful that through that methods review that there may be some changes to the evaluation methodology, which allow them to better value.

1908,3063,381,381,"Yes. Salveen, thanks for the question. This is Stuart. So obviously we're thrilled. It's been a very productive quarter in terms of new reimbursement agreements, which is great, as we complete the journey from discovering these medicines to getting access for patients. In terms of the uptake, overall, I would say, really the consideration is up the same in each of the markets and the way I would think about it is, firstly, the various administrations have to put in place the process to allow physicians to prescribe these medicines. And as an example in England, they quoted that they were hoping to get that sold within 30 days. So obviously, there is a bit of a lag before we can even staff initiating patients.And then after that, really, I would be thinking about the number of patients that we have there in each of those markets. We expect in those markets, much like the other markets around the world that we will over time initiate the vast majority of those patients on one of the CFTR modulators that's been reimbursed, across the world in general, across products, across geographies, we tend to see initiation rates in the 80% to 90% range. As you know, not everybody unfortunately can stay on the medicines, so we see persistence rates across products, across markets, somewhere in the 80% to 90% range and so when we do eventually reach steady state, it's a function of those two things then we need to factor in a compliance rate, the compliance rates are medicines are as good as I've ever seen in my time in the industry, they are across products tend to be in the 80% to 85% range.So, those are the kinds of factors I would be taking into account. So that tells you a little bit about where we're likely to get to a steady state, really then question is how long is it going to take us to get to kind of peak levels of uptake and that really is given by kind of a couple of things, one is the size of the eligible patient population, if you take somewhere like England, it's 5,000 patients. That's a very large number. All of those patients are treated in the 40 CF centers in England. And so, just like here in the US, there is a capacity constraint that the centers have to actually being able to see all of those eligible patients and that's probably the biggest kind of rate limiter. So we first question expect to get to the vast majority of those patients is just likely to ramp up over time.In terms of '19, we haven't included any adjustment in our '19 guidance just because those reimbursement agreements have come so late in the year and obviously, we need to work our way through the administrative things I've just told you about before we can actually start initiating patients.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

I'll stay away from the specifics around the doses and such.

1910,3063,34488,34488,"Sure, Geoff. On the free cash flow in the quarter, we can follow up with you afterwards on that. As I highlighted, we ended the quarter with about $4 billion in cash that did not include the Semma -- the disbursement for Semma, which happened shortly after, what you can see though with our performance this year is that we are on track to end the year with more cash than we started the year. And that's even after spending nearly $1.5 billion on business development during the year, so the operating leverage and the cash flow generation continues to be very strong.Second part of your question was around operating margin, we've run in the kind of low to mid-40s in the first half of the year. We do expect, you've seen -- you saw a little bit of a ramp up in expenses in the third quarter, an additional ramp up in the fourth quarter. So we should end the year in that low to mid-40s range. Again, a significant increase over last year, which was around 39% and so with the continued growth of the business on the top line and disciplined spending, we continue to drive operating margins up and you could expect that into 2020 as well.Stuart Arbuckle: And Geoff, in terms of the breakdown of I think it was just Kalydeco you wanted US, ex-US.Geoff Porges: Well, the three markets.Stuart Arbuckle: Okay.

Obviously, now with the triple approval, we've got a portfolio of medicines that are going to allow us to treat the vast majority of patients within the medicines, there is a significant level of label overlap and we see a significant level of switching and we would expect even more switching with the triple. As a result, the very, very detailed breakdown by product becomes less meaningful over time. So moving forward, our intention would be to report total CF revenues and break that out by product. We will also break out our US and ex-US revenues, but we will move away from providing very detail product by geography.",AID_18,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

This is the molecule that's targeted at the APOL1 axis and there is -- there is a known disease called FSGS, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis, a type of kidney disease that unfortunately is relentless and really has only one outcome and that is progression to either end stage renal disease transplant or death, it's really a very significant renal disease. The way it manifests itself is proteinuria, that is to say protein in the urine. So where we are right now with the VX-147 program is we are in Phase 1 during the SAD/MAD. We anticipate that we're going to be ready to go to Phase 2, the dose-ranging study next year 2020.And while it's too early to call exactly when we're going to have results, I expect it to be a very modest size study given the small patient population that has this disease and the very grievous nature of the disease. So in that dose-ranging study that will get off and running in 2020, I anticipate the endpoint there is going to be proteinuria, which is very convenient because that is the endpoint of significance and it is the proof of biological activity.",QID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

1916,3063,27281,27281,"Yes. So Geoff, in terms of what have we learned in terms of getting access here in the US, I would say going back all the way to Kalydeco through Orkambi and Symdeko, we've seen very broad reimbursement and actually that reimbursement has been put in place pretty quickly. Now, obviously it's a range across all of the government and commercial payers and so some move faster than others, some move slower than others, but in general, we've seen them move pretty quickly and we've ended up with kind of rapid and broad reimbursement. I think the thing that gives me hope that that will happen is obviously we've been out there with these payers now for seven years in the US, they have a very, very good sense of how severe this disease is, the benefits that our medicines have and the team is out there now talking with payers. And today, as I say, in terms of the reaction we've had, the reaction to date has been very positive. So I feel very good that our team is very well prepared to secure broad access.In terms of insurance barriers, yes, there will always be some, we have a great team here which is trained to do justice to help patients out and provide support to them as they navigate the insurance barriers. In terms of what are we going to do in supporting those patients who may have financial needs, we have the standard suite of offerings that you would expect and first question our commitment is that we are going to do everything we can to make sure that no patient is left behind because of their ability to pay.",AID_13,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1917,3063,8727,8727,"I'll take the Semma question and then Stuart, will take the England question. With regard to Semma, I'd just start off reminding you that type 1 diabetes is a disease that fits our strategy perfectly right, it's a serious disease, about 1.25 million patients in the US that are treated in a relatively small number of centers by endocrinologists, so you can first question reach them with a specialty sales force and interestingly, despite the fact that insulin has been around and has saved their lives for almost 100 years now, it turns out that insulin therapy for these Type 1 patients is not really a very good long-term way of returning them to normal glycemia or normal hemoglobin A1c levels and so they, as you know suffer from very high rates of cardiovascular disease as well as from multiple hypoglycemic episodes.So there is a large unmet need, obviously with this patient subset and it fits our strategy. We also knew for more than 15 years that if you can successfully transplant islet into these patients, you can essentially cure the disease. There were a number of studies of small numbers of patients, who were transplanted with cadaveric islets under immunosuppression and maybe those patients were not only cures, they were long-term cures, some of those patients were up more than a decade. So there were really two issues with Type 1 diabetes, and we've been watching it as one of our diseases of interest for some time. I'd say obviously David Altshuler, is a diabetologist as well as the geneticists, so he has been keenly interested in this disease.And the two problems were there weren't enough cadaveric islets and so you need a different way to naked islets and the other problem was the need for immunosuppression was potentially limiting to the number of patients that you can reach. So we were watching companies who are addressing those two problems for the last two, three years. And over the last six to eight months, we were convinced that Semma has actually solved both of those problems. So on the first front, they have figured out how to take ES cells or even iPSC cells and successfully differentiate them into human -- into human cells in an industrial fashion, so they can make industrial levels of a human islets and they've shown that those islets and animal models actually are able to cure diabetes when they're transplanted. So that was the solution of the islet number problem and then they've also invented a device that is able, in which you can put the that's able to protect them from the immune response.And so, Semma really has two products, they have what we call naked islets that they can transplant into the liver just like cadaveric islets are transplanted into the liver that does require immunosuppression. And they have a second product, which is the islets in the device, which we believe can be transplanted ultimately without immunosuppression and that obviously opens up the number of patients, that could be treated substantially.So in summary, it's a disease that fits our strategy perfectly, it's a specialty disease, it's a disease of high unmet need, and it's a disease in which these recent scientific breakthroughs have given a new approach towards the transformative therapy, so it's a perfect fit and when we saw that we were able to move pretty quickly.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

So what we've been measuring in the animal studies is what we will be measuring in the human studies and it's a reasonably easy, I never like to say easy in terms of a clinical trial, but it's a reasonably simple assay and it's the same a functional assay that you've seen us do in the animal studies.Stuart Arbuckle: Yes. Paul, just on the UK, just to be crystal clear, the current agreement, the one that we announced last week, the current commercial agreement does not include the triple combination, it includes Kalydeco and its approved indications Orkambi and Symkevi.

I was showing our Board today that I think we've done more deals in 2019 than we've done -- than we did in 2016, 2017 and 2018 combined and that's a good thing. Obviously, we have both diversified our pipeline and we've also considerably built our toolbox and you should expect to see us continue to do that. I think we've been pretty consistent all along in saying what you probably shouldn't expect to see us do is to buy on-market assets or very late stage assets to essentially buy revenue growth. We don't really need revenue growth; our CF franchise will provide that well into the 2020s. And so, we're in a very nice position of being able to invest in earlier stage assets, where by the way, we think we can get much better value and also add much more value from our own internal development and regulatory group, so that we can build much, much better value both for patients and for shareholders.So you should expect to see us to continue to do deals early stage assets, where we can add value, technology is particularly that bolt on to our gene editing strategy, which as you know we have broadened considerably over the last year and more of those deals, but I don't think you'll see us do the very late stage, first question not on market products or very late-stage products.Reshma Kewalramani: I just wanted to add to that. You mentioned the pipeline and where we are, you already talked about pain. It's actually interesting to know how many molecules we have already into mid-stage development.

But, no, that's not our approach. The FSGS component compared to for example non-diabetic kidney disease that also has an APOL1 mediated component. They're actually different enough that the FSGS patients are much more sick, the progression is faster and the levels of protein are very high, so we think that there is a real high unmet need there that we have to go at it first and get there and then we'll get to the other.

You're correct, there are a number of patients who are taking Orkambi in France. Orkambi was available through an early access program for patients 12 plus and within the French system, there's approximately 1100 or so patients who are currently receiving Orkambi. In terms of revenue recognition and how that might change, I'll turn that over to Charlie.Charles Wagner: Yes. Cory, this is Charlie. For revenue recognition, we have been recording revenue at a relatively low value for sales into France currently, when we land on an agreed-upon price, we will book a catch-up of prior period revenue, which will equal the difference between the negotiated price and the price at which we've been booking revenue that revenue as it comes through the prior period revenue, our intention would be to non-GAAP that out, as obviously it won't repeat. And then going forward, we'll book revenue at the contracted price.Reshma Kewalramani: Cory, with regard to CTX001 and beta thalassemia and sickle cell programs, here's kind of where we are. We have about half a dozen sites open for beta thal, about a dozen sites open for sickle cell, the studies are enrolling. I think you must have heard our partners at Crispr comment on the fact that we will be in a position to share data this quarter.

So while Trikafta is very, very important to them, they have a lot of other things that are going on as well.As I said, in total, there is 18,000 patients who are eligible for Trikafta in the United States, who will be treated at the 275 or so CF centers. As I said, it was about 8,5000 patients who were eligible for Orkambi, about 12,000 for Symkevi.

I think we -- the company has been on a frenzy of innovation in the last 2 to 3 years and trying through launching new products to compensate the decline in net sales. We have not been successful on that. We really have not been successful on that. Yes, we brought a lot of complexity to the system but this innovation was not translated into additional sales. It was very cannibalistic and brought much more complexity. And as a consequence, a lot of supply chain losses and lower margins. Many of this innovation was done through third-party manufacturers. So of course, that's, for me, when I arrived and with fresh eyes, I asked the obvious questions and one of them is, let me understand profitability by SKU, let me understand volume by SKU, and there's a big tail of SKUs that, yes, actually, with a negative margin or are not important at all, very, very small or both. And that can just generate a lot of complexity in the system. And so yes, we are going to reduce this, we are going to reduce.We have to have the discipline that, at the same time that we innovate and we put new products in the market we have to have the discipline to clean the tail of low margin, negative margin or a low volume, very low volume, that are really not [indiscernible] just creating more complexity in the system. And this is a capability. So going back to your point about capabilities. I think that innovation is an area that we have to increase, we'll have to improve dramatically. There are other areas that I think that we have to improve our capabilities. And -- but I think that innovation is one that I'm very focused on. It is a big driver for growth for the future, has to be especially in the food industry, but we have to do bigger innovation. We have to do fewer innovation. We have to do bolder innovation. We have to do profitable innovation and has to be incremental instead of doing everything and old products innovating and vouching and throwing new products in the market that will not really generate extra profitability to our company.",AID_4,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_no_blame

But I guess, do you see any structural reason that would preclude KHC from driving similar levels of sort of ongoing productivity as peers, let's say, as a percent of cost of goods. And the reason I ask is because I presume this is where it can be quite helpful in terms of funding the media spend investment that you mentioned today on the call, other things, inflation and such that come up all in the context of managing EBITDA to be more stable within the confines, I guess, of a constrained balance sheet.

And the second question is, do you see some synergy or the potential for bringing the two businesses together are the users of the wallet becoming more and more buyers on your e-commerce platform or should we think that the e-commerce buyers are your first adopters of the wallet?

1947,3065,53668,53669," Sure, Richard. Let me tell you about our experience in Argentina, which probably is what we are using as a base for what we are doing now in Brazil and Mexico. When we started in Argentina, we started with always on promotions so every time you went to get in a store you would get a promotion. Then we switched off to every time – these stores or payers would go lighthouses with other larger merchants, we are giving you a discount the first time you paid in each of those. And we are at that stage now in Brazil. And eventually in Argentina we were able to diminish the amount of promotion we did. The first month we did this stop doing promotions, there was a little bit of a slowdown but a month after that, we were growing at the same rate as we were before, we’re at very similar rate. So we are following that playbook in Brazil early on which had won to add as many sellers and as many buyers as possible, payers as possible and eventually, we will focus on improving and making more efficient the discounts.",AID_13,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

So we are working on how do we really streamline the whole process in terms of shipping, customs, trying to figure out if there are ways to get an inventory into country faster and therefore, to your doorstep, faster once you have ordered. I think that’s been one of the reasons why growth there hasn’t been explosive because we have really tried to focus on building out the right user experience. And we have made consistent and solid strides on that, and I think, hopefully, when we look back in a few years, that will have become a sizable business with a user experience and net promoter scores that clearly differentiate it from some of the faster growing Wishes or other players that focus more just on getting demand from China to Brazil and not so much on the user experience on the way.",AID_4,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Firstly, what do you think in terms of like what you need in terms of footprint? Is it more a question of like us getting additional distribution center space or maybe increasing more hubs and increasing potentially even the level of automation in your network? And then secondly, as you sort of think again further out and look through your merchant base, do you have any plans for also offering additional services where you help your merchants directly target their local client through sort of click and collect initiative within their stores where you could just offer the sort of interface on the marketplace and connect – to connect buyers and sellers and then also a solution on the logistics but where it doesn’t really go through your fulfillment or cross stocking but offer basically local transportation solution?",QID_9,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral

In Brazil, what has happened so far is, remember, we actually launched during the second quarter. In the third quarter, they’re very excited with the acceleration transactions on of monthly active payers and monthly active sellers we have seen. So we are very excited about that acceleration. But most of that acceleration has been driven by new users and new sellers joining the network followed by an increase in frequency.

So, I think MELI is always about potentially changing things. Right now, I think we have reduced versus prior years the level of subsidies as a percentage of revenue, but we also feel that the subsidies we offer now are a lot more intelligent and a lot more targeted. If you look at it sequentially there was actually a slight increase in subsidies, not so much on transportation, but subsidies aimed at getting merchants to send more inventory to our fulfillment centers, and that’s had very positive results in terms of growth of the managed network, and fulfillment in Brazil has begun to grow again as you saw in the numbers. Again, I want to stress. I don’t think this is a trade-off between marketing or shipping. I think a lot of the marketing spend has been incremental, and that’s what’s driven the change in the P&L profile and we are confident that, that’s the right thing to do for this phase of the business where we need to invest in growth of FinTech and user acquisition, and where we see an improving user experience on the marketplace and we want to invest behind that.

1960,3065,23757,23757,"Hi, Deepak, this is Osvaldo. Let me take the first part of the question. With regards to use cases and increasing the frequency of users, I think the main drivers have been, on the one hand, adding use cases in each of the countries where we operate and the other one is adding popularity for the QR Code networks, those have been growing in all of Argentina, Brazil and Mexico and so the things we try to do is encourage users to do more transactions but also to use more than one different flow. We find that retention rates are higher when users engage in more than one of the use cases. Towards the latter part of the question and you asked about monetization plans, we have already made public to our users in Argentina that we will start charging 0.6% for stored balance transactions and for their card transactions starting during Q3, 0.6%.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1961,3065,49316,49316,"So just one clarification, when we refer to cross-border here, the focus is really on cross-border commerce. So, it’s more on our retail business. What we are trying to do there is to offer a cross-border solution that unlike the more prevalent ones, really focus on companies that have global merchant bases and then push product globally in how we can leverage our existing marketplace and the benefits of that marketplace locally to bring in inventory, not so much intra-Latin America but primarily from Asian merchants and North American merchants but deeply integrated into some of the assets that we have built on the marketplace. So when I mentioned earlier, I think Bob’s question around tying cross-border trade to the user experience it’s how can we leverage the assets we build in logistics to get those cross-border items to your doorstep a lot faster than you would if you were buying on some of the other global platforms. How can we use local teams we have to really facilitate and expedite tariffs and customs processes so it’s less of a hassle for people purchasing on the platform. And the idea then is to get global inventory to the doorsteps of Latin American consumers. It’s not so much focused on payments. Look, marketing, again we don’t guide, I think we’ve given you guys a thought process on why we think the timing is right to pick up the pace of marketing investments. Very obvious on the FinTech space, we’re attacking many different fronts simultaneously. QR network, MPOS, cards, merchant services, and we see tremendous opportunity here and we want to make sure that we invest behind it and we need to build out the brand. And then on the marketplace, because of all the improvements we’ve made, we think it makes sense to strengthen some of the brand attributes, communicate some of the new brand attributes. Going forward, I think a lot will depend on the performance and what we see in the data around these investments. Brand investments are not performance-like that you can see immediate impact. We will be tracking key numerical KPIs through surveys, through direct site organic traffic and other ways, but we need to give it a little bit more time to see what the residual impact of those brand investments are. And I think based on that, we will have a clearer sense of how we continue to invest going forward. So I think you guys should focus every quarter on what we did during the quarter rather than forward-looking.",AID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
1962,3065,38951,38951,"Okay. So I think most of the elements you included in your question at the beginning in terms of what other additions to the managed network we believe we will continue to see in terms of incremental warehouses, incremental service centers and hubs and increased automation, I think the answer is yes. Remember that in our model, warehouses and incremental service centers, that those are OpEx, they are not CapEx, incremental automation, depending on what it is, is CapEx that, that’s a very manageable number. And so all of those are part of our network plans for all the countries where we’re building out the managed network. In terms of click and collect, Irma, so the functionality does exist. So we can work with select retailers on click and collect. Having said that however, I think our focus, not being a bricks and mortar retailer who has some cost into building, is much more on building out the fastest and most efficient network to get packages to your doorstep but potentially the overlay, and we began to do some of this in Brazil, of drop-off points and eventually pickup points but not so much storefronts of our merchants but rather nodes within our network where drop-off and pickup can occur. So our focus, I think, is more of a pure native e-commerce player for now, it isn’t trying to leverage existing physical stores and more on building out the efficiency and the speed of our own network.

And just complementing that and I think it is important is we are committed to investing behind the business if we know that there is actually an attractive business behind that. And so we felt that in Argentina, we had enough traction with the free product that it was time to start monetizing and also to make sure that we start building out a business that’s sustainable in profit over the long term. And I think that’s a reflection of how we’ve always approached our businesses and that hasn’t changed. What’s changed, I think, is just our desire to use the scale we have and the capital we have to invest aggressively to really gain users and then to, as rapidly as we can without hurting that long-term growth, beginning to monetize and actually build out a sustainable business. So that’s what we do in credit. It’s what we are beginning to do in QR. It’s what we do in MPOS.

We will charge 0.6% for both stored balance and debit cards, and this is cheaper than the going rate everybody pays for debit cards in Argentina, which is 0.9%.

This last quarter, for example, in Argentina, you will see a strong slowdown for obvious reasons. So we continue to take a long-term view on this.

And obviously, these businesses are in very different stages of growth and development. So I would argue that the steady state current – sorry that the current P&Ls and what they look like is by no means an indication of what those businesses could deliver in terms of margins and P&L at scale. Again, just to reiterate, right, if you look at many of the FinTech initiatives, right now it’s more about growth in TPV and customer acquisition and making sure that customer engagement and customer user metrics are going in the right direction, and then when we hit a certain level of scale, we start introducing the monetization model. And if you look at Argentina, as Osvaldo just mentioned, we’re going to be doing that this quarter.

And perhaps most importantly to your question, Net Promoter Scores are now higher on the managed network than away from it. At this point, roughly 6 points higher and tracking to widening that spread.

My first question is just on the marketing spend, I am looking at the slide in your presentation, which is very helpful just breaking it down between branding, performance and promotion. And I was a little surprised perhaps that so much is – about 50% looks like is on branding. The majority of that on the marketplace given you are such a well-known brand already, just talk about the decision behind your marketing allocation, and do you find that like in terms of trying to draw first-time users onto the digital wallet, that promotions and performance marketing aren’t good ways to do that?",QID_10,Question_1_Market_related,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
1973,3065,41300,41300,"Yes. So a couple of things. First of all, these include both commerce and FinTech branding investments. Bear in mind that when you should look at the branding investment probably on an annualized basis to have a better sense of overall percentage of revenues, we have concentrated a lot of the investments in Q3 and a little of that in Q4, that doesn’t necessarily signal that, that is an ongoing quarterly amount. Although we have a very strong brand, as e-commerce becomes more and more mainstream, we still see opportunities to drive more user and more top-of-mind behind the MercadoLibre brand. And like I said earlier, part of what we are communicating there are also some of the newer attributes we have. So the speed of our delivery network, the prevalence of free shipping and other newer benefits of the marketplace as it’s really improved its service. And then on the FinTech piece, if you were to look, we do have to build out the Mercado Pago brand. If you look at some of these markets, MercadoLibre is incredibly well known. Mercado Pago is a brand, which is historically on-marketplace. And so there is room to start building the standalone knowledge behind Mercado Pago. It’s the first time we have ever done any brand building for Mercado Pago. It’s always been known and used primarily on the marketplace. We do agree with you that for customer engagement and customer acquisition, promotional and targeted discounts are very effective, and that’s really where most of the promotional budget comes in is for the FinTech piece. But because we have never generated any awareness around the brand, and there are our competitors that have invested brand marketing behind their brands, I think there is room to do that as well.

1974,3065,46117,46117,"Look, I think we haven’t seen any changes in our business attributable to anything that’s happened on the Prime front. It’s very, very early stage. I would say we compete with them very aggressively and head-on in Mexico. I think we like what we are seeing from how our business continues to perform there. Brazil, I would say there is a very, very big difference between the business we have and the business they are running. And so I don’t think we attribute anything to whatever was launched by a competitor during the quarter. Correios strike is over. Obviously, it had an impact on our business. I think we said in the ballpark of 2% of GMV growth in the quarter. It was only a few days, so obviously the impact in the month of September was larger than that. I think the silver lining to this is unlike the last time Correios had a strike, our managed network, we were able to move volume away from Correios towards the managed network. That’s one of the reasons why we saw the strong improvement in managed network adoption in Brazil during the quarter. And increasingly going forward, every time this happens again, I think we will be better and better prepared to simply move volume away from whoever has an operational complication to other carriers. We can already do that in Argentina and Mexico quite well.

You’ll see a lot of that is either increased investment in customer acquisition and marketing or the entire wallet and payment strategy across multiple geos, which is something that we do want to invest in because we see an enormous TAM and a very, very large opportunity. In some cases, with longer payback times on merchants we acquire or in the case of wallet, an enormous opportunity with a very good proof of concept in Argentina but still in a market launch monetization model. And then on the marketplace, I think we have identified an opportunity to increment our brand awareness and our brand equity, so you will see in the disclosures that there has been almost the entirety of the incremental spend sequentially is on marketing.

In the past with our mini device, we were targeting mostly the end of the long-tail, which were mostly individuals. Now we are reaching to slightly larger businesses. And here, even though we are promoting it in our platform, I would say most of the new users aren’t necessarily already in the MercadoLibre platform. So we are using a sales force and we’re reaching out through to marketing to the specific merchants. We have not and are not disclosing the acquisition cost but we are very comfortable that the pricing is very appropriate and the payout period is reasonable. And we also introduced a Point Mini chip, which is a device that is targeted on the smaller merchants but that already has a telephone tip in it so that it does not need to be paired with a telephone.

1980,3065,33195,33195,"Okay. Sorry, just one thing, I got cut off before finishing the answer to the previous one. So very quickly, in terms of the software for the MPOSs, when you look at the MPOS devices that we distribute and the merchant base and the multiplicity of services and products that we are pursuing, currently, we don’t have as a high priority software or ERP-like solutions. We’re much more focused on the multiple other financial services that we’re offering and not the ERP business. We do look to integrate with existing EFPs like the Linx partnership we announced last quarter, but in general, it’s not a focus of us to build our own core ERP. Brazil, I don’t think it’s an either or question. We’re very focused on the rollout of our logistics platform. We’re actually extremely pleased with the results we’re seeing there in terms of migrating more and more volume onto our own network and also the sophistication and the results we’re seeing on that network. So that will be a poor component of our differentiation in our value prop in Brazil and that drives a lot of OpEx through the P&L. I think because we’re seeing incremental improvements in Net Promoter Scores and engagement metrics, that also gives us greater encouragement to also invest more in marketing to communicate some of those new services and new brand attributes but just in general, to attract more visitors and buyers to the category. So I think we’re being more aggressive on the marketing front, incrementally and sequentially, and it’s not in detriment of investments that we are making in user experience or technology or fulfillment. And again, we don’t give forward guidance on growth rates but I do think that we hope that all these investments could lead to a better user experience, and hopefully, that leads to more incremental growth.In terms of ecosystem and platform, now obviously we believe that, that’s one of, if not the biggest differentiator that we have and we need to focus on. I think when you look at it today, there’s probably more that we have leveraged the existing user base of e-commerce to drive wallet and FinTech usage. However, I think it’s roughly split 50-50, 50% of monthly active payers have some sort of activity on the marketplace and 50% are just net new FinTech users that hopefully over time we are able to bring on to the marketplace.

2000,3067,5878,5878,"we're following closely the PD-1 field. As you said, it is evolving. Our goal, as it's been from the beginning, is to have a foundational PD-1 therapeutic that is at least competitive, if not best-in-class. And so we're very excited, for example, about some of the data that we reported on today in terms of the response rates in our first-line monotherapy lung cancer study. But once again, the story is as you said, that we think that we have an enormous opportunity of combining with our novel sets of reagents. Some of which are already in combinations in the clinic not only with the entire assortment of checkpoint inhibitors but also with our entire assortment of bispecifics.So as I already mentioned, we're exploring combinations with the bispecifics of the CD3 class that are in the clinic already, but we've already initiated our second class of bispecifics, these co-stimulatory bispecifics, which have the opportunity to activate PD-1 responsiveness in tumors that are not normally responsive to PD-1. So not only can they enhance responsiveness in tumors that are responding to some degree already, but they can actually endow responsiveness in those that don't in preclinical models. And we hope that, that pertains, obviously, in the clinic. This creates, we think, a great way of extending the benefit that immuno-oncology has already provided by taking it deeper in cancers that are already responsive, but also opening up cancers that haven't responded to date.So I do want to just emphasize again, why do we have this ability? Because we have a unique platform for making these bispecifics. As far as I'm aware, we're the only platform that couples essentially a naturally derived bispecific antibodies using a genetically humanized mouse, together with this Veloci-Bi platform that we recently announced, to rapidly and routinely make natural bispecifics that behave just like normal antibodies.You don't have to give them by constant infusion. You don't have to introduce linkers. You don't have to make mutations in there so that they have longer half-lives because they look, and they're manufactured in fact, just like regular antibodies. They behave like them. You can give them normally like you give biologics. You don't have to go to special -- extensive lengths to manufacture them. This allows us to rapidly and routinely make many of these and put them into the clinic very rapidly in these various combinations and target them in exactly the way we want to, in some cases, initiate; or in other cases, trigger or activate a co-response.

And so we obviously have a substantial presence including group hotels in Washington.I don't know what their bookings are for next year, but I would guess that it is sort of less than average. And I think when you look at the rest of the country, of course, you'll have two conventions in two individual cities which will be good for that.

So there isn't really any message at all relative to the timing of quarter to-date.And if you look at our first three quarters they are actually quite even except for Q1, where we were a bit more accelerated in Q1, because as you remember we started off the year with a leverage ratio that was really down towards the lower end of our 3.0 to 3.5.So as we talked about, it's the same expectation for overall level of capital return to shareholders as it was last time.

I'm not certain so much in the special rate negotiations directly as it is in just the conversations we're having with senior members of the American business community.I think that apprehension is a little bit about politics, but the way you framed it, maybe makes it almost sound a little bit too general. I think it is more focused on the trade dynamic probably than politics generally. And, of course, we've got every day news about whether or not we're nearing a trade deal. I think, if we get to a trade deal, obviously, that will be meaningful even if it's a relatively small deal.But having said that, while apprehension is a bit higher, I think, absolute performance of the U.S. economy is still quite robust. It may not be reflecting the kind of growth we'd like to see on a year-over-year basis. But whether you're looking at our industry or the economy more broadly, I think you see obviously low unemployment in our industry, you see high occupancy, you see absolute performance that is fairly meaningful.And so I think we would characterize this and you can sort of sense it in what we said to expect in terms of year-over-year increases in revenue coming from those special corporate accounts.

We've been giving guidance for the year of 1% to 1.5%, but as we've moved through the year and continue to have conversations with owners, we're continuing to see that many of these hotels are staying in our system. It is not a function of u0s being more lenient relative to the kind of investment required for these hotels as we've talked to you there's been tremendous investment for example in the Sheridan portfolio as many of those hotels are either undergoing renovation or we've got agreements for them to undergo renovation.

2041,3068,38513,38513,"So in fairness a good question, Joe. The -- obviously we're disappointed by this too and a quarter ago and probably two quarters ago too. We were asked about net unit growth in 2020 or in the years ahead compared to 2019. And based on the multiyear planning that we've done much of which we've shared with you when we do analyst meeting and also just based on the obvious which is that the pipeline in aggregate size is very big and we've been signing high-quality deals every year.And while every year is not a record we have been in many respects surprised to the upside about how the new projects are coming into the pipeline. And that continues well into 2019 even with the sort of apprehension in the market. So all of those things caused us to be not just hopeful, but to have some factual underpinning thinking that we were going to see unit growth step up in 2020 and years beyond from the levels we're today.And obviously, we've given you our first look at 2020 this morning or in our release last night. And I have said we now expect it to be roughly comparable negative growth rates next year as this year, which I know is disappointing to folks. We're still early in the process so we should mention that. We don't -- we've not finalized our budget plan.I think that as we've said in the past and every quarter we go through the entire portfolio pipeline. And we add new units based on signings that have been done we subtract units when they open and we subtract a few that are killed every quarter. The number that we've canceled this last category is really not moving. So we're not seeing the worst news driving this which is that deals are being abandoned.Instead, what we're seeing is sort of all of the above for delays. And by that I mean, you've got a piece of it which is about the greater upper-upscale and luxury mix that is in our pipeline; greater urban mix which is in our pipeline where permitting and construction often takes longer. You've got continued high construction costs in many markets around the world which our owners are trying to make sure that they manage well offset a little bit by continued high availability of debt financing at pretty attractive terms.And then lastly I think you do have some apprehension about the economy generally. And so I think there are some owners it varies a little bit by market-to-market, but some owners who will look and say, I do intend to do this project. I'm going to move forward with it. But I'm going to do it maybe with a bit more deliberate speed than I would have if I was really 100% convinced that I needed to cap it -- capture this thing right away.It is an American phenomenon, but it is also increasingly a global phenomenon.

And as Arne said, it's seven hotels on for Elegant, but they total only a small number of rooms.So, it continues to be the same which is that we are opportunistic whether it’d be bolt-on or whether it’d be single-asset purchases.

2050,3068,54611,54612," So, maybe we should decide right now that we'll invite Laura back in a decade and we can talk about incentive management fees and what would that be 2029 or something like that.The -- and one context-setting comment before answering your question, obviously, the incentive fees are skewed towards -- by definition they are always on managed hotels not franchised hotels. And they skew towards more significant markets think of the top 25 in the United States or very well-established resort destinations. And they skew towards upper-upscale and luxury hotels all around the world. And it is those hotels which deliver disproportionately higher fees per room to us than our competitors or others in the industry will experience from the brands that they've got.So, while there is a bit more volatility in incentive management fees for obvious reasons, they come from the bottom line not the topline. They are in every instance fees we would just as soon be earning because they are economically additive to us and because they are strategically additive to us because those hotels make an extraordinary amount of difference.Leeny and Laura and Betsy and I were talking this morning actually I think if you go back and look at the securities analyst meeting and the 1% scenario, we're performing right in line with that at least in terms of total fees. There may be some variability in which of the three fee lines is contributing to that, but broadly we're within the range of what we've talked about.And so there's nothing here that we're going to be able to say to you this morning that gives you tremendously more clarity than what you know to be the obvious which is that when you're in a low year-over-year RevPAR environment with expenses growing at meaningfully faster rate than RevPAR is that that's going to have an impact to Marriott and its incentive fees just the way it's going to have an impact to the owner and their contribution from that hotel.Now, there are some things which exacerbated here a little bit one way or another. Hong Kong we've talked about at length this morning would have had a disproportionate impact in Q3 albeit modest. I suspect the impact in Q4 will be more significant than in Q3 because the performance there is going to be that much worse in Q4.And then you go around the rest of the world and you'll see different performance in different markets. New York, we've talked about too New York will be a place where because of anemic RevPAR growth or modest declines even in RevPAR.

And in the last year or so, we've done a handful of conversions.And I think in a sense that may prove a little bit of this theory that we were talking about before, which is where businesses under the most pressure in that instance, it's mostly about supply growth not about demand weakening.But RevPAR has been negative for the industry in Dubai. Not for us necessarily in every quarter, but has been negative for the last -- much in the last couple of years I suppose in Dubai.And as a consequence, we're seeing a bit better conversion activity there than has ever been the case in the past.

2054,3068,26164,26166,". I'll repeat a couple of things I said in the prepared remarks. So we have calculated -- obviously we're talking here about hotel-level margin performance which is really about managed hotels and principally until a comment coming up is about North America. And two things. One is we've tried to calculate what margin performance is driven by RevPAR and then what margin performance is driven by implement assets we've been able to implement because of the Starwood transaction.And that difference is about 220 basis points in North America. So, we think about 220 basis points or two full points of GOP margin has been delivered because of that. In part because, of that we end up with nominal GOP gross operating profit at the hotel level up 150 basis points from the peak in 2007. Now that's an average number. It covers a lot of variables across different markets in the United States. We know that New York for example with both substantial cost growth which has experienced in the last decade not just in wages and benefits but also in property taxes and compounded with some supply growth. We have seen more pressure there on house profit margins compared to peak than we have in some other markets.Now when it, gets to incentive fees this becomes a global story of course. And what we've seen is a continued meaningful shift from U.S. derived fees to international derived fees. And while it would be an oversimplification to say that all international IMF is less risky than domestic IMF first question on average terms it is significantly more stable through the cycles than the American IMFs are. Why? Because typically in the United States you would have an owner's priority. And until you fill that owner's priority bucket we get nothing, where in much of the rest of the world, the incentive management fee formula gives us a share of profits from the first get-go.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

But there's a lot that the team is working on. And they'll scramble to work it through. One funny thing, the select service team in the United States as they get into December, they've got this big bell that sits on the table.

2057,3068,35613,35613,"Yeah. I mean, the – obviously, all-inclusive has grown very steadily over the course of the last couple of decades I suppose and we've watched it develop. It is almost by definition a purely leisure brand. I mean, there are first question some hotels that are getting some group business that is not leisure but it is heavily a leisure play. We are really encouraged by the Bonvoy strength which we've talked about this morning, which really in some respects is about recognizing business travelers by giving them the kind of experiences they want, when they're taking their leisure trips. And with lifestyle and luxury and resort portfolio that we've got in our hotel portfolio, we've already got tremendous things to offer there. But we can see that in the all-inclusive space there's another thing that we would like to be able to offer which is a connection with the loyalty program for an all-inclusive stay which many, many travelers like to have.I think the bet we're making with Elegant is not as concentrated as it might seem. Well it's a handful of hotels in that market. It's only about 700 rooms total. So we're not in any way concerned about our ability to continue both to market that in the UK, which has been the strongest source market for those hotels, but increasingly open that market up to American travelers who will find the paradise of Barbados I think as attractive as many of the other markets in the region.And then I think we'll continue to move. I think the theory has been well-recognized for a number of years and that is -- isn't it obvious that hotel loyalty programs should be able to deliver good cost-effective volumes all-inclusive hotels. And I don't know that anybody has really proven that yet. Obviously some of our hotel competitors are already in with a handful of all-inclusive hotels, but I think it's still early for all of us. And we want to make sure that we get in there that we use our management team to both learn the differences in this business, but to also be able to make sure we can deliver our customer to these kinds of hotels.

2058,3068,62726,62726,"I mean, I don't think that's terribly germane to what we're experiencing today, okay? So the performance in our global incentive fee line is not being driven by a mark-to-market of a significant number of managed hotels for example.So I would suggest this question be viewed a little bit more abstractly than that. And there I think it's going to vary a little bit by part of the world. Leeny mentioned that about two-thirds of our incentive fees now are coming from outside the United States. Those contracts are -- they're not all uniform, of course, but we're signing brand new hotels coming into our system with incentive fee formulas and real contributions from them about similar to many of the hotels we signed a decade ago, which are in. And so I don't think there's a meaningful mark-to-market risk there long term.I think if you look in the United States or to some extent in Europe, there are some above market deals that we did a long time ago. Sometimes they were assets that we controlled and sold. And as those mature, I suspect that owners will try and reduce incentive fees there.Now to be fair, owners will always try and reduce the net level of fees that they're paying, not just incentive fees but the top line fees as well. And the negotiations there really are about what, kind of, value do your brands and does your loyalty program deliver and what are they worth.And a long-winded way of saying, of course, if some of those contracts were terminated today and start all over again, I suspect that they would start with a similar formula for incentive fees but probably with a starting point, which is lower than what they're achieving today",AID_24,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

We see -- and again I'm probably talking a little bit about the American situation at this point but probably we can expand it to some other parts of the world as well.I think that the -- what we see is our leisure customer is out on the road and they are staying with us and they're taking their vacations. Yes of course, some are doing home rentals when they travel as well. That is I think particularly more relevant for those that are most cost-sensitive, not for those who are most interested in a great experience if you will.And of course that's one of the reasons we've decided to get into this space ourselves to deliver something which is more predictable as a great experience and more tied for travelers who are interested in more than just the cheapest rate that they can possibly get.But I think leisure remains strong. We -- I met with some senior folks coming out of China not so long ago. And I think if you look at China outbound travel which is often leisure, the global numbers are still quite respectable.Arrivals in Europe from China of course are much stronger than arrivals in the United States are from China and there are a number of reasons for that.

The -- probably the most significant thing we've done with the OTAs themselves is something we've been doing not just in the brand-new agreements but probably started a bit over a year ago. And then as we have been more aggressive in essentially dialing back the business we'll take from OTAs when we project will be at high occupancies. We've had that right for a few years. We didn't use it as aggressively as we're using it now. And we've talked about that in some of the last number of quarterly calls. It conceivably had a modest negative impact to RevPAR growth year-over-year. But we think factoring in the lower costs associated with the business that came in when we turned those dials down to zero net-net it drove profitability for the hotels. And that will be something that we will continue to -- a tool we'll continue to use.The other thing, which we disclosed of course is that with Expedia, we did a -- we found a place where actually our alignment with them could be much greater and that was in the wholesale space. Wholesale is another, kind of, third party if you will that is both an expensive channel and sometimes a channel, which makes pricing integrity challenged because wholesale inventory can end up out there being passed from one intermediary to another and we don't often know where it's sold.And in talking that through with Expedia we thought well they can bring their technological prowess to bear and we can put some discipline in the wholesale market, which should make that both easier to manage from an integrity perspective. And reduce the cost of that business that comes into our system through the wholesale channel.So, that we're excited about. Obviously, we're -- it's early days in that, but the teams of both Marriott and Expedia are working aggressively.

They won't go up a lot but they will go up. And that represents two things. First of all the different quality of the incentive fees as we've talked about earlier much less of an owner's priority characteristic.And number two, in general, our managed footprint is growing faster outside the U.S. than it's growing inside the U.S. So again, when you look at those security analysts' forecast or expect models that we put out earlier this year, one of the things to remember is that we are expecting unit growth outside the U.S. to be faster than inside the U.S., which again has this difference in the characteristics over the incentive fees.",AID_21,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2069,3068,44060,44060,"Yes. The redemptions have been high this year.

Starwood for example had the Great Chica Collection in Italy principally.But Southern Europe glorious hotels and suddenly that's opened up to a huge number of legacy Marriott Rewards members. And they say, these are places that we want to try and experiment with. I think there is probably some on-sale aspect also that moved that.I think some of the bookings that could have been made through the first part of 2019 probably not into the middle of 2019 allowed some of the highest category hotels to be -- and this is not about peak/off-peak pricing, but it's about the former highest category hotels. They were on sale a little bit based on the way the minutia of those formula work.And I think you have some extraordinarily sophisticated folks who watch these loyalty programs and thought this is a good time to reserve some of those redemption stays for that kind of hotel.

One of the interesting things when you look at Q3 is that actually the percentage of international hotels earning incentive fees increased from 73% to 75%, while not surprisingly in the U.S. they declined from 52% to 41%.

And that is a pretty powerful sign that we think this experiment is working well. And it's going to work well we think for both portfolios if you look at it that way. I think what Sheraton and Westin are probably quite different in this regard. Westin is impacted by the law of small numbers to some extent more than Sheraton is. So the smaller the portfolio the more you've got some variability based on geography alone that can often have an impact to the reported RevPAR numbers.Sheraton obviously is a bigger brand. You still have some geographic differences there that are relevant. I think the other thing we've got is we've got a good amount of renovation activity underway in the Sheraton brand which does have an impact on the margins on the way RevPAR is posted in any given quarter. That might be short-term pain, but clearly it is long term very much to our advantage. But again, I think the – if you put a point out and said, well, how does Sheraton repositioning going in? We're really actually quite encouraged. The – a piece of that is implied by Leeny's comments about relatively lower deletions from the system.

And secondly, some incremental investments that we've made year-over-year in our supply chain and logistics platform. I think if you're referring to the expectation of consensus versus what we achieved in Q1, I'll say that, we really had a lot of factors that are moving in our favor. And again, just to remind you, we achieved 43%, but for the balance of the year, we expect our Connected Fitness gross profit margin for full year to be 38%-39%. So for the first quarter, though what I would say is, again, better than expected supply chain and logistics, but again, through the balance of the year, we'll continue to make investments there. They will be a little bit more back-end loaded perhaps than perhaps what is reflected within consensus. Secondly, we did have a one-time favorable inventory reserve benefit. We're piloting a resale program for a small amount of returned inventory, which resulted in a one-time benefit to our inventory reserve in Q1. We also are seeing product cost efficiencies in both bike and tread that were better than expected. And then, lastly, I would say our warranty utilization on both bike and tread were lower than expected. So it was just a lot of positive news in our favor, but again, for the full year, the 43% will continue to decline throughout the balance of the year given the mix shift in tread, and again, the supply chain investments we plan to make throughout the year.",AID_10,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

And what we found were that two biggest barriers were price affordability, and then, will I use it. And so we did a test. We don't guess. We test almost everything in terms of major programs. So we did a test earlier this year around Home Trial and what it showed is, substantial lift in the markets we tested it in.

So with our 39-month financing, zero APR, consumers have the ability to get a bike for $58 a month and we're underwriting all the costs. So it's an incredible deal. We think it's the best deal in fitness. Interestingly, that goes right against the average gym membership that most people pay, which is on average $58 a month.

Then outside of what’s happening on the app, we just saw a tremendous amount of buzz, which we think will continue to keep Tinder in the dialogue and make it fresh and young and relevant, and really addresses this audience that--you know, it needs to make sure that Tinder stays relevant in this community. We also think that the short interactive miniseries, it could work in international markets, so we’re excited to see what happens when we launch the series outside the U.S., which we’re planning on doing next year, so more to come on that.

So, look - it’s a little bit early on some of these video initiatives, but at the end of the day we want to make sure that people have a reason to keep coming back and have a reason to strike up conversations, because ultimately that will drive success.

2130,3070,12870,12871,"I think your second question related to marketing spend. When you look at our marketing spend, really what we’re doing is we’re shifting marketing spend from some of the brands that are more mature and showing less growth trajectory into the newer bets and brands that are showing more potential for growth. That has been going on all year. It’s continuing into Q4 and it’s continuing into 2020, so that’s a theme that you’re going continue to hear about. When you look at that, it’s the brands you would expect - it’s OK Cupid in these international markets, in India, in other new markets where we think we have a chance to expand OK Cupid. It’s related to the BLK and Chispa brands. It’s related to Hinge. It’s related to Pairs, which has shown great traction in Japan both in its core business as well now we’re expanding into the new Pairs Engage product. So that’s where the marketing spend is going. If you look at kind of the Q4 trajectory, I don’t think marketing spend is going to be up significantly, I just think it’s a shift. There’s more dollars going into the brands that are showing growth and there is more discipline around the spend, and that is something that we’ve been talking about for, I think, a long time. We have a very robust analytical framework to try to figure out where we should be spending the dollars and where we shouldn’t, and we’re continuing to fine tune that; but the themes around investing or increasing marketing spend in the brands with momentum will continue to be a theme and we’ll continue to try to pare back as much as we can in the brands with less momentum.  To the extent we can do product work or other things to drive back momentum in some of the other brands, which we’ve done for example in OK Cupid in the U.S., we will then spend more marketing dollars in those brands to supplement the organic growth that they’re seeing. It’s not a decision that we make and that’s static. As we see performance in these brands, we will adjust our spend levels in each of them and that’s the constant job that we’re doing, to try to make sure we’re allocating our overall marketing spend as efficiently and effectively as we possibly can.",AID_4,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2132,3070,644,644,"There’s a lot of moving pieces on the margin, so I’m going to try to walk you through it relatively clearly, and hopefully this will be helpful. When you look at what’s happening for 2020, you’ve got a couple of big things that are helping give us improving margins. The most notable, of course, is that the Tinder business is becoming a bigger piece of the overall pie, and Tinder has higher margins than our other brands in aggregate and so we get a lift from having a bigger piece of the business be Tinder. I’ll talk about Tinder margins in a second, which was kind of the second part of your question. We’ve also talked previously about giving users a choice on Tinder on Android of credit cards or using their billing system, and given that, we’ve seen some improvement from a margin perspective as users have chosen to pay with credit cards on Tinder. Those two things are helpful to our margins in 2020. On the other side of the equation, we’ve got a number of things, some of which are discretionary and some of which aren’t, that are impacting margins. Most notably, and kind of the simplest one, is legal and the spinoff costs, and I’ll come back to legal. The spinoff costs, if the spinoff goes through, we’re saying we’re going to have $10 million of costs next year related to the spinoff - that would happen in 2020 or not, and then obviously that wouldn’t occur again beyond that. On the legal side, if you look at the trends in legal, our legal costs this year are jumping significantly from last year. In 2018, we had about $15 million of legal fees. This year, we’ve got about $40 million more expected for the year, so close to $55 million, so it’s a significant jump in ’19, and then our numbers for 2020 include additional legal fees probably in the neighborhood of about $15 million or so. The jump is pretty significant from ’18 to ’19, and then incrementally from ’19 to ’20. Now, we don’t view those as discretionary. We are involved in three significant lawsuits and we are pursuing those with top flight lawyers because in one of the cases, Bumble, we think they’ve infringed on our patents and we’re expecting to be compensated for that, so we’ve been pursuing that litigation. On the other two, one related to the FTC and DOJ investigation, we think the claims that have been made in that case are meritless and we are going to defend ourselves against that vigorously, so that is increasing our legal costs in 2020. It started now in late ’19, and it’s going to take place over the course of 2020. The third relates to all the matters on the Tinder employee lawsuits, which again we think is purely a case of sour grapes on the Tinder employees’ behalf, and we are defending ourselves on that lawsuit vigorously with top flight counsel again because we don’t expect to make up the difference when people decide to sell their stock earlier and the stock price was lower, versus now we’re not going to compensate people for having made that decision, and so we’re fighting that lawsuit. I think a lot of those matters are going to resolve themselves in 2020, and so the legal costs that have jumped and are pressuring our margins by probably about two points if you add up the jump in legal costs between, say, ’18 and ’20, that will no longer be the case after we get beyond 2020. So we view those as a temporary lift, a necessary lift, an unfortunate lift, but it’s something that we’ve chosen to pursue to defend ourselves and to pursue the Bumble infringement. Then if you look at other trends in the business, in our non-Tinder brands what we’re seeing is more of a shift to apps, and so we’re paying more App Store fees on the non-Tinder brands. That is a positive trend. We think it gives people a better user experience, but it’s an extra cost that we’re incurring and is a negative on the margin side. Then you get into the two categories of investments that we’re choosing to make that are discretionary but we think are good for the long-term health of the business to help us grow the business long term. The first is, and I mentioned this in my remarks, we’re investing in a number of new bets and we’re watching these new bets very carefully. We believe they have solid traction. We’re looking for indicators of solid traction to continue to make investments in them, but we think to help continue to grow globally at the company, we want to make these bets. If you look at the investments we’re making in OK Cupid international, in our Pairs business in Japan which is growing extremely nicely, in BLK and Chispa here in the U.S. focused on certain demographics, all of those businesses are showing strong traction. We’re very disciplined about our investments into these businesses, but right now the markers that we’re looking for in those businesses are being hit, and so we’re choosing to invest. We’re doing that knowing that we’ve got this headwind from the legal expense, and so the result is flatter margins than we would like in 2019 and 2020, but we’re taking that on and basically saying, despite the fact that we’ve got this non-discretionary legal expense that’s impacting our margin, we’re going to keep investing in the business for the future even if it means short term we don’t have the margin expansion we were hoping for. Once we get through the legal issues, we’ll see that margin expansion actually occur, so we’re making that conscious choice. I think as we go through our planning process for the rest of this year, for 2020, we’re going to scrub all those investments and all those expenses and see what else we can deliver, but right now the guidance that I’ve provided reflects what we think is a reasonable level and a logical level of investments in those new brands.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_no_blame
2133,3070,15696,15697," If you look at what we’re expecting for next year, I think that Tinder will probably add, in terms of order of magnitude, a similar amount of revenue in 2020 over 2019 that it’s adding dollars-wise, 2019 over 2018. We think that will be very similar, but obviously since it’s off a bigger base, the growth rate will be lower in 2020 for Tinder than it is in 2019. That’s just math. That’s a piece of it, and then on the other side of the equation, we are increasingly confident that the rest of the brands in aggregate are going to start to deliver some growth for us on revenue in 2020, so I think it will be modest at first but we believe we are approaching the point where the other brands are going to contribute, and so if they add a little bit of growth, that is what gets us into that mid to high teens growth rate overall for the company. That’s kind of the mix - still very strong growth at Tinder, but a lower overall growth rate off the bigger base, and a little bit of contribution from the other brands. I think that that is really the dynamics around our growth outlook on the top line for next year. In terms of the Tinder subs for next year, we haven’t really provided yet an outlook on that, and there’s a few reasons for that. I think as we’ve said many times, and I guess I’ll say it one more time here, we don’t focus solely on Tinder subscriber net adds. We focus on driving Tinder revenue, which I just told you what we think we can do next year in that regard, and we get it through a mix of ARPU improvement and subscriber growth. As we start to move more internationally at Tinder, the typical western model subscription which is something that we’re very good at and has driven our business to this point, may not be right in every market and we may shift the way we approach Tinder monetization more towards a-la-carte or consumables than towards a subscription model. That’s something we’re evaluating as Tinder grows globally, and so that is something that we’re focused on. Obviously we understand we need to deliver a healthy number of Tinder net adds. We think we’ve incorporated a healthy level into our underlying assumption for next year, but as we continue to refine our product road map for next year, we’re maintaining the flexibility to make adjustments between subscription and a-la-carte as we think through the global dynamics in the Tinder business. That is kind of where we are at this moment. As I said, we will have more detail around exactly how we’re going to approach it, product cadence and everything else, as we get a little further I think we’ve done this a few times now, so the product cadence has become, I think, a little bit more clear. If you look at 2019, we had a big revenue feature in Q2, another in Q3 related to the Gold homepage redesign on iOS and Android, so I think as we preliminarily think about it, we’re thinking about some cadence that’s kind of similar to that next year, but again that’s something we’re still sorting through and we’ll have more guidance on exactly when the features will be rolled out. But suffice to say, as we had in 2019 a very robust product road map for Tinder focused on revenue and engagement features, Tinder has rolled out a lot of different things very consistently in 2019, we’re going to do the same thing in 2020 and our base case assumptions for next year assume that we’ll roll out a lot of different things. Some will be more successful, some will be less successful. Our outlook doesn’t assume any massive home runs, but our goal always is to outperform those expectations and deliver features that really move the needle. I’m sure some will and some won’t, and some will move the needle more than we hope, but how that all breaks out and when and which ones, I think remains to be determined. The Tinder team is hard at work trying to make sure that we deliver all of those features next year, and I’m sure they will. ",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2134,3070,28292,28292, I was wondering if you could perhaps comment on the trajectory of cost of revenue as we look to fiscal 2020 when you consider the mix shift to Tinder and Hinge perhaps offset by the Android app fee bypass.,QID_10,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
2135,3070,15224,15225," Tinder obviously continues to perform very strongly right now, and from your comments, into the future. What level of Tinder PMC net adds are baked into the 2020 guidance? How do we bridge the 49% growth you’re seeing right now with this mid to high teens revenue guidance as that becomes a bigger part of the business, and are you expecting the decel to come from Tinder or some of the other brands?",QID_5,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_attack

2137,3070,6385,6386,"Then we’ve got investments at Tinder, which has obviously been our growth engine. You asked about this directly, but the margins at Tinder are strong, they’ve been expanding. The last time we talked about margins at Tinder, we said they were north of 40%. I think that was close to two years ago, so you can expect that Tinder margins are much stronger now than they were two years ago. Tinder brings those strong margins, but at this point we also think it’s important to continue to make investments in Tinder because we want to get it to grow globally and get to that next level. So as we look at markets like Japan, like India, international markets where we think there is big opportunity for Tinder, we want to make sure we’re making the right level of investment. So again, it’s a conscious decision. We’re going to scrub those investments in Tinder and make sure the investments we’re making in engineering resources, overall product development, tech infrastructure, product localization, trust and safety, moderation, all the things that are important, that need to be made for this continued expansion globally, especially in these Asian markets, that we’re making the appropriate levels of investment.  We’ve incorporated into our outlook for next year a strong level of investment in Tinder in all of those areas. Even with that, we’ll see some margin expansion at Tinder next year, and as we come back in early February having scrubbed those numbers, we’ll be able to give you a little more precision around both the investments at Tinder and the investments in some of the new brands. That’s everything we’ve incorporated for next year, and I think it explains the margin trends at Tinder as well as the margin trends at the overall company.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2138,3070,10521,10522,"Yes, I think that’s all right. It’s important to understand that what we’re seeing in terms of Tinder subs for Q4 is basically what we’ve been expecting the entire year. We had a product plan at Tinder which we’ve been executing on. We talked about 1.6 million net adds for the full year or thereabouts, and we’re on track to deliver something very close to that. There is a little bit of a pull forward of terminations, as Mandy said, on iOS at Tinder and some of our other brands from the changes that Apple made, so that is affecting the sub number a little bit in Q4, but that is really, I think, the only thing that’s going on that was not expected by us all along in this year as we planned Tinder sub additions. That’s the one item, but again I think it’s mostly a pull forward probably into a little bit in Q4, probably lingers into Q1, and then I think you’ll see that effect on the Tinder sub numbers and the overall sub numbers dissipate a little bit.  As it relates to the Tinder sub outlook, that’s kind of the pieces of it. It’s first question not related to Facebook or competition in any way.  I think if you look at the overall fourth quarter outlook that we provided, there’s really two things that are, I think, affecting where we thought we’d be back in August versus where we are now. I think the first is FX, which I called out in my remarks. That’s probably on the order of $6 million incremental negative versus where it was three months ago related to Brexit and the euro and the pound against the dollar. That’s one piece of it, and there’s probably some small impact from the Apple changes that we see in Q4 as well. I think that’s kind of the top line impact. Obviously that flows down to the bottom line as well, so that’s a piece of it, and then we have incremental legal expenses. I call out $25 million of incremental in Q4. Probably half of that, $12 million, $13 million relates to legal. It’s just a phase we’re in right now in these various matters with FTC and DOJ as well as the Tinder employee and some of the other matters we have, related to discovery and ongoing preparation, which we’re taking all very seriously, and so we’re incurring those expenses and they will affect our fourth quarter. I think those are the three moving pieces related to the fourth quarter versus where we had previously expected.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame
2139,3070,29188,29188,"In terms of the cost of revenue, there are two or three items that I want to call out. On the positive side, we’re getting benefit from more and more users at Tinder on Android paying by credit cards. As we’ve said before, we think providing users a choice makes sense. Obviously the users see benefit in that because the take rates on the credit card payment method are strong at Tinder, so that is giving us benefit in terms of cost of revenue. In terms of other things that are going on, though, that may make that benefit less visible as you read our reports, there’s two things really going on, one which I alluded to in the answer to the first question on the call. Tinder is spending more on tech infrastructure as it expands more globally, to serve that more global customer base, so that is appearing also in cost of revenue and is somewhat of an offset to the benefit we’re getting from the Android credit card, so that’s one piece of it. The other thing, which I alluded to as well in that question earlier in the call, related to other brands besides Tinder moving more of their user base to apps, so we’re seeing a higher percentage of revenue being paid to app stores as a result of more of our other users coming on and subscribing through the App Store. Those are the kinds of puts and takes inside the cost of revenue line, and that’s why it had been increasing pretty significantly over the last eight quarters, or maybe even longer. It has kind of stabilized at that point because there are pluses and minuses, or benefits and offsets going on within that line, and I think that’s an important trend overall to understand in the business.",AID_10,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame
2140,3070,27327,27327,"You asked about different penetration rates. There are definitely markets where monetization is higher than North America and Western Europe. Japan is one of these examples, so high ARPU but low penetration because there’s still a lot of stigma, and that’s changing. Then there are also markets where there is lower levels of monetization but huge TAM, and so we think in both these cases there is growth opportunity for us and we want to capitalize on both of these, so we’re pretty bullish. Obviously in these markets, we said recently that in five years, 25% of our revenue would come from these regions, from APAC, and when we announced that, we were about 12% and now couple quarters later we’re about 15%, so we’re definitely marching along that path and we continue to see opportunity there.",AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2141,3070,8337,8337,"One, obviously investors are trying to understand the fourth quarter Tinder guide. You did comment about this change that Apple made which was impacting re-sign ups, so maybe if you can elaborate a bit more there, and then just what other information do you have that it’s not due to Facebook Dating?

2142,3070,9050,9050,"Okay, let me take the Facebook one first, and Gary can chime in on the other questions. When Facebook launched Dating, we told you all on this call that we did not think it would impact our business, and that is turning out to be true. Facebook rolled out in the U.S. and we’ve seen zero impact in our business, especially at Tinder. Facebook at this point is rolled out in about 20 markets starting last year, and we’ve obviously been studying and watching these markets really closely and we haven’t seen any impact in any of our KPIs across the globe. Then when Facebook launched in Canada about a year ago, we thought this was a great way to get a proxy for the U.S., so we’ve seen that now, those trends for the last year, and we’ve seen no impact in the Canadian market, so we’re feeling good from a competitive aspect at this point but we’ll continue to watch. Keep in mind, during this past year when Facebook launched in all these markets, this is also when Tinder’s growth has been accelerating globally.  The only other thing that I wanted to mention is the Q4 Tinder net add expectation is not affected by Facebook at all. We see, as Gary had mentioned, that this is an increased level of terminations by iOS related to the changes at Apple, but we’re not seeing this effect on Android nor on new subscribers, so to date we still see very--no impact, and we’ll continue to keep you all updated, but we do feel good from a competitive standpoint.",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2144,3070,20137,20137,"Well, thanks for pointing out first question one of the brighter spots in our earnings report, I think, from this quarter. We believe that the non-Tinder brands really did turn the corner in Q3, and that’s why we have confidence that those brands are going to grow in aggregate in Q4 and into 2020. You pointed out the 95,000 sequential additions, which is notable, as you say, and I think the important thing to understand is we’re getting contributions to that number from a broad number of brands. Hinge is clearly a big contributor, OK Cupid is a big contributor, the new bets in BLK and Chispa are contributing, our Meetic business is contributing, so it’s a number of brands within the non-Tinder group that are really contributing. Our goal is to keep widening that out, and I think we’re on track to do that. The reason that you don’t see as much revenue flow through as you might expect, given those subscriber trends, is a lot of those brands are still very early in their monetization trajectory. We’ve talked about this before a little bit related to Hinge, which we think there’s a lot to go in terms of monetization. It’s not something we’ve turned our attention to, but we are now starting to turn our attention to it, so that is on the plans for 2020. I think that as Hinge continues to grow users, it will grow subscribers as it’s been doing. As we adjust monetization, it will start to contribute much more to the overall revenue pie at the company, and the same is true for some of the other brands as well. Those brands are just in different phases of their development, and as I said earlier, when we’re investing--when I explained why we’re investing in these brands, we see the clear user growth, the product momentum, and now we need to turn our attention to monetization, to subscriber and revenue growth. That’s what naturally comes next. You’ve got to take this all one step at a time, and we have a playbook that we’re following for these brands. We’re going to bring that playbook next to Hinge in a very significant way, and we have a lot of confidence that we’ll be able to do what we need to do to drive monetization at those brands.",AID_6,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2146,3070,25936,25937," If you think about more developed markets like the U.S. and Western Europe, we see about half the addressable market, half the singles have tried a dating app, and then in the regions that you mentioned, we see that percentage much less. There is higher stigma, so that’s part of the reason, and there is lower category usage, but that is changing and we see that changing pretty rapidly. If you think about that addressable market, it’s huge. These are young populations that high mobile internet--they have high mobile usage and high internet usage, and they are starting to date and their parents are less involved, or becoming less involved in their dating behaviors and their choices for partners. We think that this social change that’s happening across this region is a big tailwind for us in the category and the next three to five years, we’re going to see that shift accelerating. One of the reasons that we invested in Harmonica was for that reason. Harmonica is just one example where we see that there’s this need for a young Muslim demo; in fact, the entrepreneurs that started Harmonica started it because their friends and family members felt a lot of pressure to have an arranged marriage and they didn’t feel comfortable with arranged marriage, so they thought this was a great option for serious minded Muslims, which is a huge addressable market across EMEA and APAC.

We are now in the process of evaluating the final tweaks to the configuration to lock down the entire design. The majority of the design is locked down, but we've got a - as always, when we get to this point in the sensor, what's that exact sensor configuration going to be and then we've got some algorithm and some effort to do, but none of that will slow down the clinical study. With respect to the total automation at the G7 plant, Steve, very, very truthfully said we are going to do a limited launch in 2020 and be careful how we launch in 2021. We don't want to put ourselves in a position we're talking about today, because we see that as a product that we can market to the world at great, great with great, great success. So automated lines are in design. They're being built. The equipment is not all in yet because the processes isn't completely done, but things like ordering  which have a long lead time and things of that nature are happening. And you will see significant capital expenditures by us over the next several months as we get these lines up and running. We have a great automation team we have good processes that we're counting on. They will first question be adjusted as the product becomes more mature. The product was designed to be more manufacturable than G6. So we think these processes could be simpler over time. And I'll just add one other thing, we're not just asking the guys to automate G7, at the same time, they are automating the G6 factory as well as we have automated lines for the assembly of our G6 product going at both in San Diego and in our Mesa facility.

We committed to doubling our capacity this year and by the time we exit the year in all fairness, we will have doubled the capacity to build G6 product than we had before.

I think if you look at the performance that we're seeing there are both from a quantitative qualitative perspective. Quite honestly we're operating at some of the highest levels that we've ever seen in the company's history, and that's allowing us to scale more aggressively than what we have historically and address some of the increasing demand that we see. I think another thing that we spend a tremendous amount of time looking for opportunities in the organization is just around what we call RPA or robotic automation and taking processes that are incredibly, labor-intensive and finding those aspects of those processes and automating those, so that the folks who are doing those things can focus really more on value-added capabilities to the organization in serving the patients or even our commercial team in a much better way. And I think encouragingly, we're seeing NPS scores start to reach some of their highest levels here in recent weeks than what we've seen over the last 18 to 24 months even before we started down the path of taking some of the things outside the States and into the Philippines. So we're encouraged by what we're seeing. We continue to make investments in those ways. I think as we continue to head into the future the more we can automate the patient experience with us and eliminate the need for a live person to be on the other end of every phone call the greater. We're going to have an ability to scale and improve the patient experience along the way. So those are the things we're focused on. We're encouraged by what we're seeing, but to be fair and truthful, it has been a challenge over the time that the growth has really put pressure on it and we're doing everything we can to stay out ahead of it.\nSteven Pacelli: I'll just add one other thing. We have an opportunity with G7 to reset the bar as to how we are going to interact with patients and what distribution and reimbursement channels will pursue. Everything we're doing with G6 is positioning us to put G7 its most accessible light to make sure patients can get right to it. Again our Walgreens announcement with the Medicare patients to whereby Medicare patients will be able to go to Walgreens and get their monthly supplies rather than calling us and being on the phone with us or our distributors is a major win. I was on the phone with a physician just couple of weeks ago and he explained to me his frustration with, we have three or four Medicare distributors in ourselves and all three of us, all of us ask for different paperwork, we think we can make this much more efficient for our patients with that move. And that's part of the innovation and thinking big I was referring to, we're going to make this easier.

It was across our direct markets, it was across our distributor markets and it was across all of the regions. There wasn't any one country in particular that far and away led the pack. There wasn't any one country that was far in a way behind the pack either. So it continues to be very broad based strength across each and every one of our markets and the teams are doing a remarkable job with it.\nKevin Sayer: I'll just add, I spoke a bit about the Canadian launch in September and that launch was a great success and win for our Canadian team. If I had to pick one other geography, the one I'll call out is the UK. They had a month in December that far exceeded - I mean, September that far exceeded in anything they had ever done and we're pretty proud of their results. And we got an email, hey, we just hit this mark and is pretty exciting, because we don't have widespread reimbursement in the UK. There is - it's regional, and there is a lot of cash pay.

2166,3071,10121,10122," Let me just talk through the fourth quarter for a second and give you a little bit of color on it. There is nothing significant in terms of timing that I think changes the impact of either Q3 or Q4. But one thing to keep in mind is the OUS business is a bit more choppy than the rest of our business. The sequential trends there can move around a little bit. If you look historically, international has typically been flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter and we continue to expect that's how it will play out this year. I think the other thing to keep in mind is that as we continue to move more and more of the business toward a subscription-based model, the historic seasonality is going to play a little bit differently in the current year than what we've seen throughout history. So we're trying to model that as well. I think the other thing just to keep in mind is, Q3 was truly a remarkable quarter for us. We were up 18%, sequentially from Q2 whereas historically, we've been up 8% to 10%. So for us to look at that and call it a trend and anticipate that we're going to see at the same sequential increase into the fourth quarter, that's a bit premature. We want to see this play out a little bit longer than then just 90 days' worth of experience in the third quarter. So we're trying to be mindful of that. And I think the other thing just that is worth noting and Kevin has hit on it, we are capacity - what the top end of the capacity in our guidance range and if we can pull some of these incremental opportunities forward in terms of production lines, then terrific. There's going to be opportunity to exceed what we set the expectation for. Worst case scenario is those lines come up in the very early part of January and we're often running at that point.

Our U.S. commercial business - not Medicare, but our U.S. commercial patients and our U.S commercial revenues grew at a rate faster than any quarter we've ever seen and that was the primary driver. Medicare growth continues to be good, but in all fairness, in the third quarter, we know there is some pent-up demand for patients to shift over to G6. We expect Medicare to really take off next year as we roll out our Walgreens and pharmacy delivery mechanism for the Medicare patients and make it much easier for them and get them over to G6. International was also a great quarter. The growth sequentially there was very strong. Quentin talked about the fact that we're comparing to a 93% growth quarter internationally last year and we still grew 39% over that number. So the international markets were good as well. I really can't tell you whether it's DME or pharmacy that's driving it.

2169,3071,26983,26983,"No, nothing specific around timing of spend, although I will tell you in the fourth quarter, we're going to start to see some incremental spend, particularly around the development efforts of automating these G7 lines. We have the product pretty well dialed in, in terms of its design, now it's all about designing these lines and conceptually, we know what the lines need to look like, what they need to produce. Now it's fine-tuning that work and making sure that we have them up ready to start to roll. So you've got that that cost coming through in the fourth quarter that you didn't necessarily have in the third quarter. To your point, on a year-to-date basis, we've made incredible traction from a profitability perspective. OpEx is levered over 1,000 basis points, and on a full year basis, we're going to see tremendous leverage from both an operating margin and EBITDA margin, even though it might not have been raised in line with what you were expecting. It's still tremendous improvements. I think what it tells you is that this business has the capability to perform at very appealing profitability measures, if you will. There's nothing structurally in the business model that keeps us from being able to do that. I think what we want to be able to do is balance the investments that are going to open up all these new growth opportunities that we continue to become more convicted are real. And so we're going to balance that over time, but we remain committed to those long-term profitability goals we've laid out.

2172,3071,21553,21553,"Yes, I think, Matt, more than anything else, as that business gets larger and you get into kind of the law of large numbers the growth rate continues to come under pressure. I think that you look at last year, we grew $300 million year-over-year in terms of absolute dollar growth. This year at the midpoint we're talking about $400 million of absolute dollar growth, yet the growth rate is arguably a little bit slower still at elevated levels, but arguably slower. So I think that as we continue to move into the future, the rate is going to just be pressured from the tougher and tougher comps that we have and larger base of business. But you hit the nail on the head. There is a lot to be bullish about and we couldn't be more bullish around the opportunities that sit in front of us. Within the core business itself, the alternative market opportunities, I mean these markets are enormous, and I think what we learn more and more every day, is that at the end of the day - CGM device that really opens up the opportunity to either impact cost, improve a patient's life, whatever it might be it comes right back to our device. So we couldn't be more bullish about the future, but at the same time, we're not going to get ahead of ourselves.

We had a very good new patient third quarter and so that has not been an issue. With respect to patients reordering, we have not seen a change in re-ordering patterns from our patients; they are ordering what and when they can and when their insurance will reimburse for them. So there is no real difference here as to what we've experienced in the past. In reality, what we're experiencing while working through is getting product out to them as quickly as we can. Sometimes they wait just an extra day for the product, sometimes it's as long as a week. But we are getting product to everybody. We'd like to get it to them sooner and we'd like to have more at our discretion here, but we're keeping up with everything and we're doing well.\nSteven Pacelli: I think, Margaret, the only thing I would add is, it's a combination of both, right. I mean patients continue to become more and more aware of the technology and find their way to the device and clearly our commercial team continues to do just an outstanding job of up-creating opportunities as well.

2177,3072,13607,13607,"Yes, the question with regards to our cost structure, I think when you look into Q4, I think we said 2 things. We said that from Q2 to Q3 sequentially, we're able to increase our non-GAAP operating margin and net margin for 2 reasons. One is the operational efficiency, and Robin talked about that. With the stronger mobile ecosystem, users are stickier, they're coming more for better technology searches and so forth. So that's helping us. And the second factor is our cost management initiatives that we've implemented. Obviously, these types of factors would be able to carry through going forward. So when we look at for example Q4, I expect we would have a similar impact as we did at Q3, meaning that margin should be similar to Q3.

So it's not easy for us to index every piece of content as we did during the PC era. So what we are trying to do is to build our own mobile ecosystem so that content and services can be more native to the Baidu ecosystem. I think although these are the challenges, but these are also opportunities. Once we can build a healthy and strong mobile ecosystem, the user experience will be more indigenous, meaning that our users get better experience, and our customers expect better conversion. We are in the process of transitioning. So that's why you see that traffic, probably, a leading indicator that is growing, but the revenue side or the monetization side has not picked up that significantly. So going forward, we are continuing to push on the mobile ecosystem, in fact, with all of our organically built content and services. And on the AI side, I think that the main challenge is that the market does not grow as fast as some would expect.

And the disparity between traffic growth and revenue growth is that we basically explained all the headwinds, industry-specific regulations, self-enforced discipline in certain industries like health care and macro.

So not only for the videos itself, like even in search, we see that search satisfied through videos increased almost 50% year-over-year.

Our core business, which is the Baidu mobile ecosystem, centered around search and feed, is a knowledge- and information-based mobile ecosystem, and we're leading in this part in China. Using the pillars like Baijiahao, smart mini program and Managed Page, we are fostering a healthier and stronger ecosystem, and this will continue to be the highest priority for Baidu. As our experiences in the Baidu mobile ecosystem continue to improve, we do not have to spend as much money to buy traffic as before. So that's one of the reasons you see the margin improving on a quarter-over-quarter basis.

And on the AI-enabled new businesses, we think all are very promising. And DuerOS, we think we are the very clear leader in the conversational AI space. It has cost us a lot of money in the past, but going forward, I think the overall loss will continue to narrow for the next 1 or 2 years.

So it's not that easy to change user behavior from a browsing habit to a search habit because for browsing, users do not need to do much, so it's easier to do browsing. If you ask someone to transform from an easier-to-do thing to a harder-to-do thing, that's not that easy. But on the other end, if you want to transform those users who are used to search, who are used to typing or express their needs explicitly to a browsing behavior, that's much easier. So that's why it's easier for Baidu to do feed, but it's harder for a feed player to do search. And on top of that, I think the technology barrier to search is very high. If you can solve the search problem, you basically solve the AGI (artificial general intelligence) problem, because whatever the users say, you have to be able to understand that and come up with relevant results, which requires a lot of research, a lot of investment, and it's a very hard problem.",AID_16,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2192,3072,22508,22508,"Greg, yes, so with regards to the 2 expense items, we talked about TAC. TAC still grew 5% year-over-year. I think TAC's growth rate has levelled off. It's growing slower year-over-year than our previous quarter. I think a couple of things. Number one is as we focus more on building our mobile ecosystem, we're going to be relying more on in-app searches to grow our revenue. And we've been transitioning off this, I think, over the last year. I think The Street misinterpreted our strategy to move over into in-app services because in-app services we are required to pay for channel costs upfront and then you would have revenues over the following quarters. When we look at the user lifetime with TAC, every dollar you spend get that revenue in that same quarter. So as our business model shifted, margin shifted, and The Street took, I think, several quarters to understand that. So I think that's one issue. And I think overall so far, I think we are having still increasing other costs. I think TAC price is still increasing, but I think it's not hitting us as bad on margin as the previous quarters. With sales and marketing, as Robin mentioned, we were still spending heavily on sales and marketing. But on a year-over-year basis, we're down for sales and marketing plus G&A. I think we mentioned in our prepared remarks how much we spent for channel and promotional marketing is a function of investment return. Although we don't expect every dollar we spend to get a return in the same quarter, we would measure over the lifetime value of the users. So as the economy softens and we're seeing the returns are not meeting the internal threshold that we had set, then we'll tone it back. You can see, for example, Baidu App is actually quite profitable because it's a good segment of our overall business. So I think with the economy like this, we'll be more careful in terms of spending. We're looking for a return that we can get. But as the economy gets better and we're seeing good returns, we might increase that in the future.

2210,3072,19488,19488,"And let me talk a little bit more about our revenue makeup. With regards to verticals that you talked about, auto and financial services, those are both down, right? Automobile, as we know, the number of car unit sales this year is down. If you look at the industry, it's not doing as healthy. If you look at financial services, that's another area that has been down since Q1 this year, and this has been down pretty significantly. On travel, we've been focusing on building better products. We have good content. We have a strategic relationship with Trip.com and so forth. And so travel overall has done well. It's one of our stronger verticals. With regards to health care. If you look at health care, we started introducing Managed Page last December. And at the end of March this year, we required that everyone who's doing advertising in mobile on Baidu to switch over their H5 sites to our Managed Page. And that has put a damper in terms of revenue on those who would probably have put quality content. Customers just will not come to Baidu. And then because we now have stronger control of the content that on there and so forth, we are putting emphasis on ensuring that the content on our pages are good for our users. And we started then rolling out on to PC in July, which is less than 20% of total health care revenues. So in Q3, really, it's a partial quarter hit. Q4, you'll see a full quarter hit. So we actually have seen most customers who are switching over have switched over. So we don't see too much of a difference from Q3 into Q4.We're halfway through the quarter. So as of right now, we don't see too much difference from Q3 to Q4. But if you look at it overall, our revenue guidance for Baidu Core in the last few quarters, we had more uncertainties, and we started with a range of negative percentage. And this quarter, now we're guiding from 0% to 6%. So we think that in terms of year-over-year growth, we're much better off in the last couple of quarters. I think in May, we said that we'd come back with a 100-day plan. We executed very well from both top line and bottom line. And so you see our business getting more solid and that the products that we talked about, the hosted marketing platforms with the strengthening mobile ecosystem, so that's helping us, I think, fight the current softer macroeconomic environment.",AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

And perhaps, I can set the context, as I talked about some of the conversations that we are having, that I personally have had, and first question our sales people are having with our customers in the automotive space.When you consider the aggregate of what the automotive customers are dealing with, with electrification – and, by the way, electrification is not uniquely something that's being driven by the automotive companies in and of themselves. There's also government regulations and other activities that are driving their desire to meet certain deadlines, and dates, and so forth. But if you consider electrification, you consider the opportunity with autonomy.As just two examples, there is a profound change taking place, and there is a significant level of investment that we are seeing and interest that we're seeing in making sure that they can address these upcoming needs or these upcoming demands for the portfolio. In many cases, a – an activity, a focus on electrification might – isn't just about the battery. It's a much – it's about a broader outcome. Because building an electric car requires different points of optimization than building an internal combustion engine car. The transmit – everything is different or many things are different.And so, there – and that opens up incremental opportunities for us. So, from our perspective, the fact that we've identified electrification autonomy, and we have compelling solutions in those areas in addition to the rest of our multi-physics solution, we believe, positions us very well. Those are growth areas. People are spending R&D dollars in those areas to be competitive in the future.And we have technologies and solutions that addresses those customers. And so, when I talk to automotive customers, the conversation often starts with electrification or autonomy. We may eventually get into other conversations of traditional – that we've traditionally had with them about structural integrity or air flow and combustion in other areas.

So, it's a more -- it's a pretty sophisticated technology. It couples electromagnetic thermal mechanical modeling capabilities.

And we've increased the of the number of those accounts from just a handful, a little over a dozen a couple of years ago to around 85 today.And as I mentioned during Investor Day, and I think I walked through a case study of a particular customer, which shows how by focusing on that customer as we would with an enterprise – as we do with enterprise accounts, by focusing on the customer, we were able to deliver significantly incremental value to that customer, a customer based upon the capability and the full suite of our portfolio. And that translates into incremental growth opportunity.So, for that particular customer that I walk through, we had a modest growth for a number of years. And then as we started to focus with them on an enterprise account, we grew ACV by about 10% in the first couple of years as an enterprise account. And then, subsequently, we've grown ACV at about 17% CAGR over the couple of years afterwards. And there's still a significant opportunity ahead because of – in the case for that particular customer, there are opportunities of that in a number of other areas. And we're seeing the story being repeated across our enterprise account base. By focusing on the accounts, we can deliver incremental value to our customers, and, of course, that translates to incremental growth.

The revenue, when you look at it from a revenue perspective, because of the volatility of ASC 606, you'll see some variations in revenue which may not necessarily align exactly with sales activity.

2244,3073,43881,43881,"Hey, Mark. Thanks so much for the question. So, as I said Dynardo is a process integration and an optimization tool. And their flagship product is something called optiSLang, which is essentially a design optimization solution. And so, the idea is as a designer you can provide – you can try to solve for a multi-objective optimization problem.So you can establish a set of boundary conditions and use cases and you can use Dynardo to drive the simulation to get to an optimal point where you're trying to get to with sensitivity, reliability, design capabilities, and so forth. So you can drive that optimization and you can you can use line to be able to change these simulation flows so you can automate the design space exploration.So effectively, what it's allowing you to do is very rapidly chain together different elements, different simulation elements, solve for a point of optimization that you're trying to get to in an automated way and that allows you to reduce development time and of course it can accelerate product design. So that's the nature of the technology and – engineers will use it to try to rapidly get to a conclusion that they're trying to drive but it drives an enormous amount of simulation, it triggers off an enormous amount of simulation in order to get to that design point.",AID_17,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Ajei, based on your prepared remarks, it sounds like you're continuing to see really good demand from the auto industry, but I think a couple of your design software peers have called out at least selective weakness with some of their auto customers.

2248,3073,26581,26581,"With respect to your first question regarding the products, first question some of the newer products that we have in the marketplace and perhaps some of the acquisitions, you're absolutely correct. Our strategy as I've described is to make simulation pervasive which means we want to make simulation capabilities. We want to inject them into multiple ecosystems into multiple use cases.If you look at some of the work we've done with our platform and in particular with Minerva that allows us to take the ANSYS simulation capabilities and to inject it into other phases of the product lifecycle, and to be – and to drive the broader use simulation and first question our acquisition of Dynardo fits right into that. So, that gives us access to more customers, helps us solve more problems.And some of the acquisitions that we've done, you mentioned Granta, I think material is a very important aspect of the end-to-end product equation. In many ways, material is a lifecycle unto itself. It's very closely related. It's almost a platform unto itself so it's very closely related to a Minerva activity. But materials gives customers a real understanding of where the true costs are and what the design implications are, and that exposes us at the different levels in an organization in a customer as well as the different sets of customers.You mentioned LSTC, and I was pretty broad in my comments. I think in my script I went through this in some detail. But the fact is that the LSTC technology because of the nature of the technology and because of our go-to-market, we have not been focusing on the core LSTC use cases that like for example automotive crash testing.And now that LSTCand LS-Dyna is part of the ANSYS portfolio, we have an opportunity to position the breadth and the depth of LSTC across industries – of LS-DYNA across multiple industries and by putting our technologies together we think we can solve – we can help our customers really solve the most amazing problem and do so very efficiently.So we're excited about those acquisitions. They all fit with our strategy of pervasive stimulation. They fit with our go-to market and our go-to market supports the acquisitions and then their relationships that these customers have with their own channel partners with their own customers further supports our go-to market.

There's there's been a lot of consternation over the macro environment but clearly I think the breadth of your portfolio and global diversity was able to offset any of that weakness. In your prepared remarks you talked about China. It seems like that's factored into your guidance. But I wanted to dig in a little bit more in the UK, obviously there’s a lot of questions on Brexit.

You mentioned in your in your comment about multi-physics and that’s really the strength of the breadth and depth of our portfolio and how we think about our go-to-market opportunity. One data point I'll point you to is the comments that Ajei had in his prepared remarks is that if you think about the large deals in Q3, 80% of those deals included products from four or more major, physics families.

You should think of them as large players who are brands that you aspire to have this business with. So we've been very, very fortunate to have notched a bunch of wins of large institutions who are heavy e-com players. And I think of it in that manner. I think also you can see us having a larger tax rate in our ISV business and other avenues where we're attaching more e-com to our small business and medium-sized ISVs. And yeah, we do have a somewhat privileged position as being a processor for some large players also, but I think when you look at the totality of what Jeff talked about in the winning space, it's been more at the front of the shop not at the back of the shop.Jeff Yabuki: Yes, it's really been quite impressive. The list of names that the company has been able to bring into this table over the last couple of years, including a number of important names this year, as Frank said to some extent, aspirational names in industries that we are aware of. But there's also a fair amount of middle market, most of what we're seeing right now is in the OmniPay space, but in that middle market. So we're making great progress there. And we're building out a model where we're delivering incremental services so that we're able to create more value on a per transaction basis. So, it's early.

I mean I heard the 15% bookings growth in the quarter, but just some context on what you're seeing at a high level across the businesses. Your peers are obviously seeing really good results too. So it's kind of curious, a lot of concern about the macro economy, but a lot of companies in the sector are not seeing it. So I'm just curious what you're seeing?",QID_15,Question_1_Market_related,Question_2_open,Question_3_attack
2261,3074,18307,18308," Sure. Again, Brett, remembering that we're not giving guidance, we'll give you -- we'll kind of try to give it to you at not the goalpost level, but maybe at the stadium level. So, we had talked about the fact that we expected revenue growth to be at least 7%. And there's a reasonable amount of variability as you start to move across the 50-odd line of the 7%. And that is, how does synergies come on, how quickly do they come on, how do sales go, how do implementations go. Probably the most important thing for us to lay out is, as we sit here today, a lot of things have to go right as always, but everything doesn't have to go right. And that we really thought a lot about what was going to be the right way for us to give this early visibility to '20. And so, we feel like this is a good solid number and that there'll be ways to outperform it. And as Bob will remind me later, there will be ways for us to underperform it. But we do feel on balance that we are in a pretty good place in terms of that -- in terms of the 7%.",AID_10,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2262,3074,27712,27712,"Sure. So, I would say that you if you think about -- you have to think about at least for us -- for us original Fiserv people. We've had to open the aperture and we're happy to do it. We're not just serving primarily financial institutions anymore. We're serving really everyone who does something in the world of payments, commerce, money movement and fintech. And so, from that standpoint, when you think about the entire ecosystem, there's a lot going on. And what's happening in financial institutions is -- financial institutions are biasing their spend to areas in which it's most -- where it is most visible to their customers. So whether it's digital -- sorry, whether it's consumer or commercial by things that are digital, abilities to serve clients in an Amazon-like way that's really where you're seeing money go. And then, just money movement payments that entire space is just fraught with energy and innovation and everyone is looking to make sure that they're on the way. And because of the breadth of the company and the investments that we collectively have been making over the last few years, I think, we're fairly well-positioned. What we have to make sure that we continue to do is that we meet our commitments and deliver for our clients because that's really what they need most right now.",AID_15,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2266,3074,9603,9603,"Hey, guys. I just want to touch on -- look, if we hone in a bit more on the First Data growth, given the source of strength and upside versus prior rates. I mean again, you mentioned the strength in GBS continuing to trend well. If we could just break that down a little further on perhaps even in the US of the Partner Solutions business, the direct business, JVs, it seems like the partner solutions continues to really hold in their strong.

2268,3074,29148,29148,"Jeff, I think, I know the answer to this based on all your commentary for 2019 guidance and your outlook in 2020, but just wanted to get your thoughts. As you have conversations with banks and interest rates are moving all over the place and they're getting pressure on their net interest margin. I'm assuming that's not having an impact on their spend at least as far as you can see and that's the reason for your confidence in 2020. Is that kind of fair?",QID_16,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
2269,3074,19781,19781,"Yes. It's Frank. I think you got to think about what we're doing today as continued investment and still getting better growth, right? And the JVs are always a good discussion to have. But I think you got to move to a bigger discussion, which is ISV growth, how long is that runway which is huge. This investment we made in Clover and the hundreds of people that we had developed it out that has us delivering as you heard caught in the $100 billion GPD mark and growing at 40%. So, I think it's all the elements of it, and then what you heard us talking about in e-com. So, a little bit, I'd move away from the dialogue about a JV or a bank channel and move more. And yes, we love the bank channel. You hear us talk about 20 wins in 100 days through the privileged position that Fiserv had. But I would not try to understand each one of those. I would understand the macro trends of ISV, e-com, Clover and digital distribution.Jeff Yabuki: Yes. And I think Brett the thing that's important here is, remember, as we move to more of a GAAP methodology for recognizing the revenue, we were able to unshroud some of the underlying performance in first question in GBS in the subsegment, formerly known as GBS North America. We were able to unshroud that. Now there are contributions that come in. And I would say that we have had growth contributions from the JVs that are better than they were last year. I would also guess that, that is the smallest of the contributors. And to Frank's point, the other pieces of the business are growing faster and will be faster growth vehicles not because as Frank said the banks -- the bank channel and the JVs are not important, they're critically important and we're going to do everything we can to grow them. But we think that the seeds that have been planted in First Data for the last three or four years, whether it be Clover or BluePay or CardConnect or a lot of original or internal development, that it takes time for those products to be built and come to market.

But as you know, we talked about the fact that we have actioned annualized run rate synergies of a couple of hundred million dollars. But the substantial majority of that is going to pop in next year. I would say that synergy the idea of synergies in our numbers for 2019 have not had any meaningful impact on how we have set our guidance. They're an important part of next year.

2274,3074,94,94,"Yes. And maybe to start out, I mean, to have guidance over 7% for next year, what seems like is happening is First Data has kind of gone from a few years ago losing share to actually -- it seems like they're gaining share now. And you guys kind of called out digital ISV Clover Global Solutions all that fast growth stuff. Is North America actually kind of in an acceleration mode? And maybe how big is the really fast growth part now?

2275,3074,10272,10272,"So let me start and Frank will again add in -- will play off of each other on that. To answer your latter question first, we've seen exactly no revenue to-date from the bank channel. Lots of energy, as Frank talked about, 20 wins in 100 days and a large pipeline and lots of interest, which is particularly important now in a time where fee revenue is increasingly important and we're obviously looking to help our clients. So lots there. We are making real progress in deeply integrating the Clover technology into the digital solutions in which we control with our development shop. And so we don't have to deal with some of the exogenous factors that can get in the way of digital performance. So, from that perspective, that's all good. But again, to reiterate that's not in the numbers at this stage. It's really across the Board in merchant. Obviously, the things that we like to talk about are the digital commerce technologies and the things that are ""a little sexier"" than maybe some of the others. But partner solutions continues to be incredibly important, whether it is our business consultants who are out signing up merchants every day or signing a new ISV provider or a new e-commerce solution, it all comes together. And I think Bob in his prepared remarks talked about the fact that, that merchant locations overall are up double-digit year-over-year. And I think that really just talks to all things of what we're doing and how we're focused on driving the business in kind of one important vertical at a time.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2276,3074,15012,15012,"Yes, it really has to do more with the level of investment that we have been making in our solution sets over the last few years and building product and having that product come to market. And that product has been a combination of internal builds as well as some small M&A that we've done that is enhancing our overall value proposition, specifically in some of the not surprisingly in the digital arenas. So, from that standpoint, it is really just about products that we've built. And I don't know that I would count it to be around growth in bank IT spend, but I do think it is the -- it talks to the importance of making sure you're building solutions in the places that matter most for clients. It's also around areas like deposit transformation, risk, fraud, the normal areas, mobile, digital as we talked about.

2277,3074,5004,5004,"Thanks, Lisa. I think, first of all, you -- I know that you've watched the international growth of First Data, and it was very, very targeted. And countries that we believe had a good payment economies had lots of runway in cash to cashless, and our ability to bring our skill set and tools there, and partner with great banks also. When we looked at the company, we found that the ability to take both institutions, put them together, run a very, very integrated business in each country and in each region, and then begin talking to our clients, that is one of the favorite things we like to do, visit clients, talk to them, talk to them about the solutions. So as we said before, I think there's great opportunity for us to bring merchants and issuing product into old Fiserv clients. And we think there's great opportunity to take many of the good products we have everywhere from dovetail to the way we could have hosted solutions for institutions which we have great relationships with. And I would say international, if you went to where we originally started, it's a much brighter spot and opportunity in totality, and our regional heads have been often running and doing a great job in integrating this company.Bob Hau: Lisa, I would only add, when Frank and I and the teams were going through the combination analysis and looking for where were the big opportunities, we to some extent put international off to the side, because we had in the original Fiserv such a small international presence. And even though we had a fair amount of country diversity and maybe a larger amount of product diversity, we didn't necessarily think we would have the scale. And one of the things that we've been pleasantly surprised by is because of the infrastructure, the scale that First Data brought to the party, we're able to take our solutions, host them for clients and run them and create recurring revenue. And there's been a lot of energy. If you're in a local jurisdiction, you want product, and we had a lot of products. There are a lot of relationships. And so, we've got a lot more energy going back and forth. And we will now -- because of the combined company, we have reasonable scale.

So, our breadth that what our development teams are doing is continuing to build functionality that gives us more vertical depth. We've gone outside the U.S. You see us in Canada. You see us in Europe. You should expect the releases in Latin America. We've been tremendously advantaged as we were strategic in Argentina and how to capitalize on that change, and Clover was part of that strategy. I would also say as we continue to build out functionality with the combination of our ISV solution in Clover, the ability to bring the two together for a best-in-class solution for merchants who use integrated software is what you'll see happen.

2282,3074,22558,22558,"Yes, let me start, Ashwin, on that. It's a couple of things. I mean, when Frank and I got together and we talked about this, one of the many points of serendipity was Frank had believed that having an access to be able to get deep integration to a core processing system was really important. And then, we are the largest core processor in the U.S. and really in the world. And so that -- the ability to drive integration, different levels of integration and access to information will allow banks to create a more compelling integrated merchant experience for their customers, and also because these are revenue-sharing partnerships be able to create fee revenue. And you know Ashwin that fee revenue right now is really important. And so you've got a convergence where we love the fact that we not only are -- we have these great relationships with clients, but we get to pay them. And that -- we think that actually works quite well. And it speaks to the 20 wins in a 100 days. I just think it speaks to the fact that as we had talked about historically, especially at the smaller end of the ranges that Frank was talking about, you have banks that really haven't paid a lot of attention to it and they see this as a great opportunity to go out and serve their customers and to create some additional fee revenue. And Frank, I think I would say it's going a little bit better than I anticipated.Frank Bisignano: Yes, I mean, off to a great start.

One thing that I'd like to know is, give us a sense of where there you could maybe do better than that, where there are kind of the tougher parts that you have to kind of perform better on it.

2284,3074,25499,25499,"Yes. I mean this privileged position that we have with the banks, until you go visit them and actually can talk to them, you're not really sure how it's all going to turn out. Now, we knew that we both had deep love of financial institutions and they were our lifeblood. But whether it would turn out this way wasn't all that clear. So, we feel good about how that's going to come out and over the long haul, be worth to heck a lot of money. I'd say, secondly, you heard us talk about international. That's probably something that most people and it's all only put the two together that we would be so bullish on. And I don't think we initially had it in our base case, so to speak, when we thought about it. Maybe we thought we'd save some money. But I think the revenue opportunity there is pretty large. And then, when you move to the spaces like our credit business and putting these two together, it becomes very clear. I'd like to say the biggest proof point for us has been the client's office, right? There's no better thing than Jeff and I have had the benefit of doing multiple client meetings together, and then obviously we do things separately. But it's so clear the power of the franchise and we always come out with more opportunities and more thought. Network will obviously, like credit will be big for us.

So it's nice to have the confidence to kind of start doing that immediately. Just wondering what kind of pace should we expect while you're paying down debt should be kind of more of the historical norm of quarterly repurchases or maybe I'm more muted into the debt to further pay down? And kind of as a follow-up to that, given that kind of confidence in your cash flow generation, should we maybe expect to see incremental M&A perhaps earlier than expected?",QID_7,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
2286,3074,29617,29618," I would say -- I would say, it's probably too bold to say it's not having any impact on their spend, it is. But what we're seeing and we've seen this before is institutions are making choices. Perhaps their discretionary spend is going down or they're spending less on older systems and more on newer systems again where the institution meets the customer in the places that matter most. So, I do see that going on. And the conversations are how do we do more, and in times like this where you are a full-scale provider, you have opportunities to go in and win more business. And so, we're first question hoping and building strategy around the fact that we think the suite that we bring on balance is the best in the market. And so, we're looking to Frank's point about how we have client conversations and there's more interest in doing things. There's a lot of opportunity to see, can you do things more efficiently and effectively as one larger enterprise. And so, that was one of the things, Kartik, that we liked about this transaction is, yeah, on one hand, there are some that say it's best to be pure play.

2287,3074,13306,13306,"Yes. So, I would say, one of the things that was in our prepared remarks is to make sure that we pointed out that we're buying under a 10b5 plan. And so -- which means that we would expect to be regularly in the market. I would say that we will not be in the market at the pace that we were at before. We are absolutely committed to making sure that we meet our leverage commitments to the agencies and we will for sure do that. And that will come from a combination of cash flow generation, debt repayment and growing EBITDA. So, from that perspective, I think we will pace it well, but cash flow is strong and we feel good about that. We also had a couple of smaller divestitures in the quarter. And so, we'll be looking to create as much opportunity as we can to deploy capital as we have historically.I would say that M&A itself is not a particularly high priority, differentiating and winning in the market is. And so, where there are opportunities for us to deploy capital for M&A and it's meeting our normal disciplined capital allocation deployment, then we're fine.

2288,3074,626,627," So Dave, there's a lot of questions that are in there. Let me take the first part of it, and then have Frank fill 1in the blanks and perhaps Bob will have something to add to it as well. I would say that if you start kind of at a little bit more of a macro level, you'll remember when we got on the phone in -- on January 16th and announced the transaction, that it was our belief that there was a mismatch between what was going on in the company and how investors were thinking and what we were seeing. And what we are seeing was that Frank and the management team had really put the company on the right path that they were making fantastic progress. And I'll let Frank talk about that. And it's an incredible testament to what the team has done to have delivered 10% growth both in the quarter and the year-to-date. But it was our belief that technologies such as Clover, right, with over $100 billion in annualized GPV growing at 40%, which is actually an increase from the prior year's growth rate. And then you think about Integrated Payments and ISV, and e-commerce growing 30% in transactions that, that these pockets were moving absolutely in the right direction. But don't forget, there's still a big partner solutions business. There's lots of other pieces of the business that continue to just move in the right direction. So, I think, we have a lot of room to continue to run and we'll be focused on that. The e-commerce business signed 30 new logos this year alone.So, we're taking the right steps and we're moving forward. And I think we believe that it will continue to grow. And also obviously, we have our international businesses that have been growing quite well. Frank, why don't you...Frank Bisignano: I think the only other thing I would add is, these are technology-based businesses. Our acquisitions going back in time to us buying Clover, fully integrating Clover into the company, but letting it thrive as a Silicon Valley entity. Then the acquisitions in the ISV business, which is beginning to really show up, which were CardConnect and BluePay, and bringing that technology, integrating it in an integrated company and bringing technology on top of that to bring the best solutions that we thought technically were in the market. And then, e-com is a constant investment for us and you can count on us having continued investment in all three of these to continue a growth trajectory in those businesses. And international has been a star for us, but that was something that we started out with very little market share. And you see that as a strong double-digit grower for us. But the technical business, the partnership in this new company will just help this. I mean, if you want to ask about North America, you hear us talking about the privileged position that Fiserv had with its great core clients. And the reason why we've been able to go in, and I think you got to absorb that 20 wins in a 100-day period of time, that's from start of discussion to signing. And when you have $6 billion institutions and competitive takeaways, it's about the privileged position that Fiserv had with these clients. And I think Jeff and I have thought about good ways to bring it together, ways always that the clients are delighted with.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2289,3074,16345,16345,"Sure. I would say that at this stage a couple of things. Number one, this is not meant to be guidance. And the more detail that we give, the more Bob will not be happy with me. So I think we're going to keep it at a pretty high level. The second thing I would say is, remember that we intend to re-segment the company. And so, when we give guidance, we'll be giving it across a new segmentation model. And so, I think again getting ahead of that wouldn't make sense.At the higher level, I can tell you that we feel quite comfortable that the kind of growth that is being delivered in the company is sustainable. And so, there's always going to have ranges around that sustainability. But generally, if you think about the former GBS segment of First Data, 10% growth in the quarter, 10% growth for the first three quarters. To us, that feels like a level of sustainability around that. And we think that each of our segments will continue to grow. You'll remember that it was important for us to look for, how could we continually and sustainably step-up internal revenue growth, and so we'll look to do that. And then, the last piece is around the synergies, right? And synergies, understand that -- as you know, synergies have to get sold and implemented. There are some things that come on faster than others. That's -- what I would say is, we would expect that to be more back-end loaded as some of the revenues come on.

However, we are happy about the 5G traction in all of our adjacents from upgrade of Telematics in automotive to 5G, we've seen a lot of industrial IoT applications and even our small cell business is getting traction including with traditional infrastructure vendors. So we expect that to be a growth story in as we head into 2021 and '22. In '20 the ones I want to single out is CPE for mobile broadband.

And perhaps more importantly, it seems like it's up very nicely, almost 12% year-over-year in fiscal ' 19 and still despite that sequential decline in your fiscal first quarter is still up, the better part of 10% there. I was wondering what's driving the sequential decline, the year-over-year increases.

The second inflection point will be in the fall time frame when another set of flagship devices will adopt 5G. So that should be kind of the shape of 5G adoption through the year, and how this translates into margin is, we gave guidance for our second quarter margin. We are expecting from first to second quarter revenue will go up mid-teens and operating margins will also be in the mid-teens range in the second quarter.

2303,3075,19279,19279,"So the way to think about it, it's pretty much at this point by market, for example, the United States market, all of the devices they have launched, there is a requirement for millimeter wave that the spectrum utilized by all of the three of the four carriers right now and therefore we have seen the initial launches of millimeter wave. Going into 2020, the current planning assumption is you're going to start to see millimeter wave also coming in the Korean market, is going to come into the Japan market, and in the later part of '20 and beginning 2021, you start to see that in Europe. And that's how it's going to change the mix. So right now, you should look at some of the China launches that we're going to see in '20, they're all going to be sub-6,and the Europe in '22 first half will be sub-6, Japan, Korea, and United States are going to have millimeter wave.

2304,3075,5661,5661,"I would just wanted to start off firstly on the -- by focusing a bit on the RF front-end opportunity. You mentioned that most of the design wins you're seeing kind of both the modem and the RF front-end go together. So just wanted to kind of get your thoughts about how you're thinking about market share in RF front-end and the early-generation 5G phones to do some of the incumbents in the space and then how should we think about sustaining that market share and kind of the second-generation, third-generation 5G phones?",QID_5,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral

We actually have seen a very high percentage. Virtually, all of the 230-plus designs now for 5G content have Qualcomm modem to antenna design. We have seen in those devices, some of our existing incumbents continue to support and provide content for 4G, but the 5G position of Qualcomm is very strong. What we are very happy especially at this time, as we head into the Q2 ramp of 5G, we see now as we go into second-generation designs for these -- for the second-generation devices as well as lower tiers, we have maintained that pattern.

You're correct about the seasonal -- seasonally lower quarter, but that is also offset by a stronger mix because we launched our new premium tier chip and new high tier chip during that quarter as well. So there is a mix implication before we get to the 5G benefit. And then the third factor is our -- what we have disclosed previously, which is with 5G devices on a like-for-like device basis, we expect 1.5x monetization as a combination of the chipset and the RF front-end revenue on top of it.

You talked a little bit, I think Akash about what it was going to do in the fiscal second quarter. Can you just talk about the seasonality of that? Is the range that you've given in the past of kind of the $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, is that the new range in kind of the weak quarters and the stronger quarters be closer to the $1.4 billion you just did?

2314,3075,10101,10101,"So our ASP per MSM has a very high sensitivity to high and premium tiers and I guess if you look at what happened in the quarter and the guide for the next one, I think consistent with what we said on the last earnings call that we're going to see the dynamic throughout the calendar year. We have seen a weaker market, weaker demand in China and that combined with Huawei gaining share in domestic China as well, that's one dynamic. The other dynamic is OEMs canceled some of the 4G flagships and moved their portfolio towards 5G getting ahead of the launch. So that created basically a change in the composition of MSM because of the high and premium tier units as we go through that transition. However, the inflection point for Q2 is where you started to see the effect and when we talk about at the 1.5 times. If anything, the guide that we provide in Q2, it contemplates the core market environment, the typical seasonality of our business, no significant changes in OEM share and does not include yet the ramp of the Apple business, you will see that change just with the 1.5 which in average has higher ASP content on the modem plus the RF front-end.",AID_8,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

First, I think, it's been very clear that our early investments in millimeter wave have provided Qualcomm with a significant technology advantage in having the technology to maturity and we're optimistic about millimeter wave going from the United States initial launches into Korea and Japan and other markets, including being license already in Europe where Telecom Italia was the first one happening throughout 2020, that's a very good thing for Qualcomm.Having said that, I would probably say that every single launch of a flagship OEM today with the exception of Huawei, they use their own silicon, every other launch of every other OEM has been a Qualcomm Snapdragon platform, and that positioned us very well about partnering with OEMs for 5G ramp including Samsung, which we have not only launched with the traditional markets, but also I point you to the A Series, which is the second tier below the flagship that are being launching with Qualcomm globally in addition to the Galaxy Fold.So those are positive things as we think 5G transition for Qualcomm",AID_3,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2323,3075,21453,21453,"So, on the Snapdragon platform today, the attach rate on millimeter wave in sub-6 is the same. I think we have modem to antenna designs including RF front-end in all of the Snapdragon. There are very few exceptions, and sometimes exception is just one or another band and is very small quantities. I will say the absolutely majority of the devices, we've been winning RF front-end across millimeter wave and sub-6, is not unique to millimeter wave. However, millimeter wave drives a lot more content because unlike sub-6 you need multiple antenna modules and multiple RF change of millimeter wave. So the content is disproportionately higher on the millimeter wave side.Akash Palkhiwala: C.J., on the mix of sub-6 versus millimeter wave within the 200 million, at this point, we're not disclosing a mix really. But the way to best think about it is what as Cristiano mentioned earlier, is by market and so there are certain markets, US and then Japan and Korea next year, where millimeter wave would be required from an operator perspective.

And the one - - the two things that are different with 5G versus transition from 3G to 4G is China is adopting 5G at the same time as the other geographies versus in 4G they were a couple of years late. And then also within 5G, we are seeing multiple tiers of products being launched simultaneously, which we did not have for 4G. So that's why we think the intensity of the 5G rollout is actually faster and you have China as a big portion of it happening early in the lifecycle. Of course, in addition to that, we are obviously talking to all of our OEM customers and we have a very good sense of how many devices they are planning to launch over the next and several months with 5G and at what price points and that also allows us to inform our tops-down forecast.",AID_9,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2328,3076,17313,17313,"I guess I'd take first just on mobile strategy generally, remember a third of our business is on mobile already. And we have the largest mobile gaming presence in the west. And so we want to build on that leadership position and we think it's a -- we think it's a foundation of strength to do that. It is a massive opportunity and we think not just for Call of Duty and not just for Diablo Immortal. And it's worth still pausing and talking for about Call of Duty, Mobile for why it's such a large opportunity. I think first it shows that the AAA kinds of games we make are ready to work on mobile because of the improving compute and graphics capability. Honestly because of evolving player expectations. It's now the case that many of the most successful global games are RPG, first person action, strategy. Those all aligned as you might imagine very well with our portfolio. We have a growing ability to execute. And we're seeing that franchise, familiarity and awareness matter, matter fundamentally in like to the tune of 100 million of people that when you reach out in the right way of franchises that are willing to come in. And so that's the level of opportunity we see. In terms of what we'll make you might imagine we're looking at all of our franchises. We want to do it where it makes sense and we think about it strategically in three main buckets. The first is extending existing game play. This is what Call of Duty, Mobile -- taking the best of Call of Duty quite literally in apps weapons characters and it's brought that over for mobile experience. So that's one bucket where we are looking at a number of opportunities to go do that. The second is reimagining the IP on the mobile platform. You can think about this like Hearthstone, which was really a reimagination of the Warcraft IP and the card game and it – that works very well in mobile. So you might imagine, we're pursuing a number of ideas like that. And then developing true cross-platform titles that work from the start across mobile. Some of those take time, but we are anxious to move. And you mentioned one already in the pipeline and there are more to come.

2329,3076,9884,9884,"So I think it's a theme that you've seen across Activision Blizzard. And I think it plays itself out quite nicely as well at King, which is we're often finding that our biggest opportunities are in our biggest franchises. Releasing Candy Crush franchise is a great case in point on that. So we've increased the resources in the Candy team. And you, as you mentioned, the results are pretty evident. I think in Q3, we had the fourth consecutive quarter where we had year-on-year mobile MAUs and net booking growth for the Candy franchise, so really strong results from that focus on the candy opportunity. And I firmly believe that the opportunities in the Candy franchise continue to be ahead of us. We're continuing to introduce quite a bit of features and content and innovations in our live ops environment that drives player engagement, and we are expanding the network, as you see in our MAU trend. So as we continue to focus on that, I continue to see a lot more opportunity in our Candy franchise. I do want to highlight, though, that we are also selectively investing in new IP. And there, we're taking an approach of fewer, bigger bets, a very focused look at our pipeline. As you well know, launching new mobile IP is tough in the industry. But the combination of the creative talent at King and the sizable network that we have gives us a good advantage. And you've heard probably on previous calls, and we talked about our advertising efforts, we continue to push hard into that. And we continue to move that momentum forward.

2331,3076,22000,22000,"I guess, maybe taking a step back first. We are increasingly seeing in the industry and we think it's first question true for our franchises, that they exist above and beyond any single platform, that there are franchises that appeal broadly across multiple platforms. As mentioned, this -- we believe now is eminently true on Call of Duty across PC, console and mobile. And if you go back several years ago, that wouldn't have been true for Call of Duty. But now robust growth across all three of those. Overwatch, of course, across PC and console, meaningfully and Hearthstone across PC and mobile meaningfully. So I would, first, just start with the premise that we are well above any individual console change, and it is about the broader nature of our franchise across multiple platforms. Of course, all that said, we're excited when large partners want to come in and expand their platforms. And so that includes consoles. And that's next-gen looks to be getting ready. We think it's an opportunity to continue to showcase our premium experiences. We also think increasingly you see consoles being iterative and that gives us the opportunity we believe to keep our communities together. It's why we've made such strong investments to keep communities playing together and either put those in the market or announce that we're doing so. And we think that continues with this console generation has to come. I'd just remind you consoles are only about one-third of our business, maybe different from some of our competitors. And so we, kind of, see ourselves having robust growth pipelines across all the large platforms out there. You ask finally just about economics and that we always look to bring our IP to bear on appropriate large platforms as long as the economics are right. I would not get into specifics about royalties at this stage. But we have a long track record of making sure that our IP is fully understood and valued by our partners. And I just -- I think the broadest point to remember is right now you have a lot of well-funded platforms coming in, looking to build out gaming reach and they're looking for great content and they're short of it. And we find ourselves, we think very fortunate and well-positioned to have great content to bring to bear.

2332,3076,350,350,"Thanks for the question Mike. It's Rob. I think it's really important to first talk about our overarching principles and what we're trying to do. We're focused on bringing the community together, building one big community and keeping them playing together through great content and features. The changes that we've been making are first question in service of those principles and we believe they're not only great for our players but also for growing and sustaining long-term engagement, which of course is critical to our long-term success. Now I do want to talk about some of the things you mentioned and some of those changes. We did eliminate the season pass and instead we'll be focused on dropping free content to the community, so everyone can enjoy it together. Tomorrow is actually going to be the first free content drop for Modern Warfare and we're excited about that. And the much bigger things that are yet to come for the community. And we also implemented cross play for the first time in the franchise to keep friends playing together no matter what platform they're on. And I think this was actually really important. And I'm seeing it in how friend groups are connecting already. Players who haven't played Call of Duty together in years are doing so, and we think that's really great for the community overall. Now we're also implementing a new battle pass system, which you mentioned and it's going to launch later this quarter. We feel it's the right thing to do for the game and how it's designed. And more importantly, we think it's the right thing to do for our players. That launch is still ahead of us but we've been really encouraged by the early response from the community to the change that we're making there.

2333,3076,7147,7147,"Last week at BlizzCon was a really big reveal for Overwatch 2 for us and the teams. And we're -- the reception has been great and we've been really humbled by that. One of the things that you alluded to and I think is worth really kind of articulating is this idea that the team has around redefining a sequel. And really what does that mean? And so, if you think about for PvP, we've communicated that all the players of Overwatch will play on the same maps as players of Overwatch 2. And in other words there'll be one map pool. Then we've also announced that all players will have access to the same set of heroes. And the principle for this is that no one is left behind and that we really are not splitting up the community. We've also communicated that we want to honor the collection from the existing game. And so everything that you've earned will carry forward into Overwatch 2. And the thought behind this is we've worked hard to build a strong community and we want to move forward as one. For PvE as Coddy talked about we're introducing lots of content for Overwatch 2. Players really asked for a back story and a narrative in the Overwatch universe for -- since the very beginning and we're really excited to create a huge amount of replayable content that really does that. And we also think this PvE content will bring entirely new players into the Overwatch universe. So the overall goal is to continue to build the largest community possible in the game with excellent content and a commitment to really continuing to release different live content than you've seen historically at a higher cadence. So stepping back to your question on business models, we're always looking for the appropriate business model for each franchise and Blizzard were lucky to have several different experiences or several versions of different business models. I think that players, it's proven that players demand premium and differentiated content and many of the Blizzard launches are premium experiences.

2335,3076,19936,19936,"So you asked about Classic specifically, but I think it's important to note that we think of World of Warcraft as a single community. Launching WoW Classic into the existing subscription was very intentional. We made a conscious choice to have one ecosystem and one engaged base of players. The goal of that system was frictionless movement between classic and modern. So now we have a large group of players and we have the challenge of keeping them engaged. And I think we have a number of different ways to do that. In Classic, you've already seen the first example with the Dire Maul update, which was released in mid-October. And we've seen player engagement into Q4, with subscriptions in some regions continuing to grow. We also have the added benefit for Classic with a known content road map for players. Switching to Modern WoW, at BlizzCon we announced the next expansion with World of Warcraft: Shadowlands. And so that's more content and more flexibility than ever before. And so it's a good position for us to be in. Personally I'm super happy with World of Warcraft and where it is, announcing Classic two years ago was one of the highlights of our professional career and to see the excitement of the players and the joy that has kind of come from that is awesome for me personally.",AID_8,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2337,3076,11986,11986,"Probably the first thing I want to do is just step back and say that overall, this is a pretty special time for Call of Duty across Mobile, our traditional console and PC business and across e-Sports. We're seeing significant success and traction on all fronts. With Call of Duty Mobile, on your question, we've obviously have a great game, a high-quality game. We've talked about the installs over $100 million in under a month, which has been fantastic. We're seeing strong growth in many geographies like India and Brazil, more so than we've ever had in our history and it's providing a real step change in reach for the franchise. And frankly, just growing the brand in all new ways, which is great to see. We also just had a really strong launch for Modern Warfare which suggest we're creating a really strong franchise ecosystem globally, where these products are actually complementing one another and not competing with one another. This is exciting news for us on a number of fronts, including how we think about cross promoting, our products across this ecosystem both now and I think well into the future. Now in terms of the mobile metrics specifically, we're obviously very pleased with the installs and we've referenced them a number of times on the call. But importantly, our retention has been really strong and that's due to the great game quality and great game experience we have, as well as the quality of our ongoing live operations. We also have a compelling content pipeline ahead, that we believe will continue to drive our business results. So right now, we feel great about where we're at and we feel good about -- and really good about our prospects for the future. But I do just want to come back and close before I started. With the success on Mobile, with the success of Modern Warfare and with the Call of Duty League launching in January, we do think the best days for the franchise are squarely in front of us. And that's a pretty cool thing to say, given all the success we've had in the past 15 years.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2338,3076,24754,24754,"Well, as you can imagine we've learned a lot. Probably the most important thing is that we underestimated things like the demand for the broadcast rights, sponsorships even on the licensing front. I think we also underestimated enthusiasm that we would have from prospective owners, which is why the price of the teams went up so much over the two-year period. And then I think, operationally, we had the benefit of two years in a fixed location to really think about how to optimize production. But as we go out into the local markets next year, which is the big point of differentiation for us in our view, between us and anybody else that's thinking about esports, is really engaging these great local entrepreneurs and professional team owners or professional groups in actually generating revenues, marketing, new fans, new opportunities for our fans to connect to their favorite players. And so what we've learned over the last couple of years is serving us incredibly well as we launch the Call of Duty League. And in fact, most of the owners are existing owners, and most of them have jumped in at prices that are higher significantly than what they paid for their Overwatch teams. And I think we're going to get the benefits of scale of being the biggest operator of a professional esports league anywhere in the world. The other thing, I think, is we probably didn't appreciate how big the viewing audience was. And if you look at the demographic that we serve, principally 18 to 34 year olds, the audience that we're serving on a global basis is bigger than the MLS for that demographic or Major League Baseball for that demographic. So there's an untapped opportunity for sponsors, for advertisers, for our licensing partners to be able to reach an audience that has become increasingly difficult to reach. So I think from every perspective, not only have we learned a lot, but I think what we've done in terms of execution is the best that anybody has expected or seen in professional e-Sports. And so when you then think about what's happening in these franchises, whether it's the announcement we just made about Overwatch 2 or the new 100 million consumers that just came into the Call of Duty marketplace and community, we're seeing an incredible amount of growth in both the opportunity for spectators, but also in audience that we'll be able to reach for our sponsors, our broadcast partners, advertisers. And so when you look out over the course of the next 12 to 24 months, there will just be a lot bigger ecosystem for us to be able to take advantage of. And a lot more of an audience for our players -- our professional players to be celebrated by and recognized by. And so, we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we've been making.

2340,3076,4117,4117,"Well, first, as Dennis highlighted on the call, we're sort of particularly excited to be this side of BlizzCon and to being able to how Blizzard walks through just what's coming in the upcoming content pipeline there. And when you couple that with the initiatives underway at Activision and King, we do feel that we're looking at the strongest content pipeline that this company has had in its history. And one of the reasons for that are the important steps that we've taken over the last year to make that possible. The investments we've made in our development resources, the focus on our core franchises that push to make sure that the content cadence across upfront live operations in mobile sits across all of our key franchises where appropriate. And we took some steps as well to make sure we could fund that by de-prioritizing other areas, all in service of getting to this moment where we could show the content cadence where players coming up and deliver to expectations and above. I think the early results are a really important sign post to look at on this growth road that we are on. When you think about WoW Classic, it is a major expansion coming into that universe. In an off year, typically it's every other year extension, a major expansion that comes in and has a significant step change impact on the reach of that franchise. Similarly, CoD Mobile. While partners outside development to pull that off, we had to make significant investment inside our production and publishing capabilities. And, again, a step change in that franchise's reach engagement. And then Modern Warfare, which we think stand-alone in terms of an experience and, as Rob highlighted, will continue to do so. So those aren't just sort of green shoots, those are real sign post and milestones of the growth that we think is possible. And it points to what we think is coming, some of which you know concretely. WoW: Shadowlands coming in 2020, Hearthstone Battlegrounds, Warcraft III: Reforged. There are items we haven't announced the dates for, but were significant moves for the community, Diablo Immortal, Diablo 4, Overwatch. And we have a similar level of investment and focus coming up in the pipelines that are at Activision and at King. And so, when we step back, we feel like we're at this moment where we can take this significant pipeline forward.

By the time somebody gets to be an adolescent, if their disease has been severe they've often had a liver transplant. In fact liver transplants in the U.S. are recommended between the age of a 1 year in preschool. And when a kid with MMA shows up for liver transplant they move to the top of the queue, so there's not much waiting. Those who don't get a liver transplant often suffer from kidney deterioration and do a Phase I trial with really abnormal kidney function.So we have gone back in the summer as noted to discuss with FDA, lowering the age criteria. They had agreed to take it down to the ages of eight and above. And while we're still in dialogue with them about that the amendment to enable us to do that has just recently opened at some of the leading institutions.

So they're now open not just in Finland as they were but actually in Germany and in the Netherlands and are actively looking for patients.The good thing about that trial is that the endpoint once they enroll the subject should be relatively quickly because it is a six months endpoint.

We've done long-term models in animals and have used that to extrapolate. So far the technology has extrapolated nicely from all the preclinical species in the various modalities. And so I would expect this one to be similar. So, I expect the dosing strategy to be once every two or every three weeks. So, I think we're going to have to define that and see the effect we have on Phase I.There is a whole slew of biomarkers here that one looks at and I think it's premature to specify which one is going to be the one. It is true. I think what you're indirectly alluding to is that the biomarkers on PA are not maybe as clear-cut as they are in MMA. I think that remains to be proven. I think, the information we hope to achieve from the natural history study in terms of biomarker levels where we're collecting it should also be informative. So, I mean we'll continue to update that as we learn more. I think our understanding of the literature and of our natural history level here is evolving.In terms of the level of expression needed, I think it's hard to quantify. What we've seen from our preclinical models suggest that it is a similar level that we need of MMA in order to have the effect in the mice be effective as profound in the PA models as it is in the MMA models. And so, we expect a similar dosing level to be required for both. It may be a little bit higher given that in PA we are encoding for two proteins, not one, right?

Now the path to Phase III I think the big change here for me has been the fact that FDA has provided guidance that speaks of the potential for licensure based on the prevention of primary infection.And that's very significant because that means that it is imminently doable with the trial of the size that we've discussed. In terms of launching that, I would say the two gating factors that I think to actually launching that study are going to be the Phase II data and some regulatory discussions. This was just very preliminary initial guidance of course before one launches a Phase III trial here, we'd need to have those more deep discussions with FDA and other agencies to make sure we're launching the right study.Now once we get their agreement, I think the design is fairly straightforward, one would expect an incident rate of about 1.5% a year.

It's hard if not impossible to actually demonstrate a clinical benefit in the seropositive, although of course I remain intensely curious about that.The second point to note is that FDA in their response had told us that they understand that one is not expected to demonstrate the benefit in seropositives. But in order for this vaccine to be viable in terms of access to patients and having an impact on the population, you would need a label that would encompass both populations. So the expectation is that we would demonstrate immunogen -- I'm sorry prevention of primary infection in the seronegatives, but we would demonstrate safety and tolerability in the entire population that is all-inclusive of seropositives and that could lead then to a label irrespective of sero status.",AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

The first is the totality of safety and tolerability data that we've seen across the portfolio are consistent with what one would expect. We haven't seen anything surprising. There's no scientific reason to expect anything untoward and we haven't seen anything untoward in preclinical.So I think this is going to be a vaccine platform that will behave as such. In fact, the CMV data suggests that the more potent the vaccine is, the more adverse event you get there were flu-like symptoms. But the adverse event the type of adverse events as I've noted is what you'd expect. I think the other reference point is the fact that this is -- the platform as a platform is no longer considered as an adjuvanted vaccine by the agency.

To be able to really offer them something that is what they want to buy and that's something that's very important because if you just throw up a search result that has no relevance to what they really want, you're not going to get much of a conversion.But because of the data we have, and we have more data probably than most any other travel player around, we use that in a way to make sure that we're offering up to our customer what they want and that's how you can help create that higher conversion. They're happier. It was an easy way for them to get what they wanted that builds the loyalty, they come back, we get more data.And again, circling back to the connected trip, the more we learn about our customer, the more we're able to then present to them all the things they wanted to know. If it's a leisure trip, what other things do they need. If it's a business trip, what things do they need. And that is just such an advantage of a smaller player and it's an advantage over any individual supplier in the travel ecosystem because they only see a small portion in their data of what the person was.So, even the largest hotel chain doesn't know anything about their customer in terms of what sort of ground transportation they want or what sort of restaurant reservations they like to make or what kind of air they generally want to do and what kind of attractions they want.

I mentioned a couple in my prepared remarks, but let me give you a little bit more flavor.So, in the third quarter, constant currency, we saw about a 3% decline; in the fourth quarter, expecting about 4%. When we look at that, about half of that decline is due to lower rates in key countries. And the ones I call out would be US, Japan and Hong Kong being the largest contributor to that piece of it. And about half of the decline is due to a mix shift towards lower ADR countries away from higher ADR countries.Now, some of that is affected by macroeconomic factors and those are impacting both rate and mix, and I'll describe what they are and I'll give you a flavor as to how we think they're actually playing out relative to just underlying trends.So, for example, less China into the US is impacting ADRs in the US with less inbound international travel. So is less and less expensive travel from Europe into the US due to the strong dollar. So, factors driving US ADRs on the right level. Less travel from South Korea into Japan is impacting ADRs in Japan. And, of course, travel into Hong Kong generally is down considerably that impacts both occupancies and ADRs there.But these economic factors are also impacting mix as well. They don't only impact rate. They impact mix, with less travel into high ADR markets – I mentioned US and Hong Kong – and more travel to some of the lower ADR markets, for example, other markets in Southeast Asia.So, you kind of put it all together and there are many factors that are impacting these global ADRs. It's difficult to be exactly precise, but we estimate about half of what we're seeing in the second half of this year is driven by external macro factors and about half of it is due just to underlying changes in our business. And remember also, we're comparing against two quarters where we saw unusual ADR increases last year. So, you kind of put all that together and you say, adjusted for that compare, our constant currency ADRs are down about 2% in Q3, about 3% in Q4, and about half of that we can attribute to macro external factors that should normalize over time.",AID_16,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_negative,Answer_3_blame

And it will come from both sides, both the higher revenue recovery and also through better cost efficiency as we roll the platform out, as we generate more scale, as we continue to refine the underlying structure of the product.As we said, long term, we first question view that it can be not only a contributor to EBITDA growth, but also a profit center, but we don't want to quantify that right now.

A lot of those people are already there. Now, you start going to other areas of the world where people are going online, but they may not perhaps go to some of our traditional paid channel areas.I'll give you a perfect example. We talk a lot about China is a great opportunity for us for the long run. Google does not operate in China. So, all those new people coming online to buy travel, we've got to find another way to get them. So, that would be an example. And there are other places like that. So, I think that's probably the primary reason for it.Whether or not this will reaccelerate, let me know if Google is going to start having a full service in China, in other areas. That's one of the things that we know it's – in the end, what's most important for us to get customers to come to us directly. We've talked about this a lot in the past.

In the past, when there have been slowdowns, the distributors have achieved greater success because of the need for the suppliers to get more customers. So, that is something that we believe will happen again when and if there is a true slowdown. As I pointed out, the industry is still, I believe, generally healthy around the world with pockets that we've described earlier.I do believe that, in the long run, the growth in the industry will continue to exceed GDP by a few points and that is the way we always plan it out. So, there's going to be always some ups and downs in the long run. But, yes, we may gain a little more when there is a recession. And when occupancy rates are very, very high, there obviously is less need for a distributor like us.But in the long run, we'll continue to provide greater services and greater benefits to both sides of this two-sided marketplace that will allow us to achieve the success that we think we should.

James, on merchant – and, obviously, just to clarify, the shift we're talking is the kind of rollout of the merchant platform of Booking.com at Agoda and Priceline and we do a lot of business on the merchant model already today. Booking.com, we continue to make progress. We gave you a data point a couple of quarters ago as to how many countries we're live in. We're continuing to add to that. We're continuing to add merchant capabilities in the US and make those available to a wider range of our property partners here as well.

So we are guiding for December, approximately 50% so we still have some lingering issues there with the Huawei business.And then of course, when you look ahead into March and June we will go through our normal seasonality, but then in the second half of 2020, as we get back to a sequential growth, growth that is fueled by 5G new, complex, highly integrated products, as well as our [growth] [ph] market business, we will start seeing gross margin improvements all the way up to our target multiple of 53%.",AID_4,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

The challenge with it though is, it has some technical road blocks right. You need to have some very complex beam steering to implement this. There's some line of sight limitations; there’s some cost limitations to it and what we're seeing is some of our handset partners are just not ready right now to engage in that technology, and often for you know sub 6 gigahertz, 5G technologies where the market is pretty rich and the opportunity is pretty rich.So I think there's a possibility for millimeter wave to play a role in this industry and you know high capacity environments, sporting events, college campuses where there's a great deal of density. There could be an opportunity for that, but right now it's kind of still on the cusp of whether the adoption will take place or not.Meanwhile, we're hedging our best; we’re investing in the technology; you know we do a lot of our work internally as I mentioned with the Kelly Marcin filtering.

2463,3080,17010,17010,"Yes, that’s a good question and so I’ve answered in the previous question there, some of the headwinds of course is the Huawei revenue that almost disappears and Huawei was running on or about 15% percent of total revenue and so that’s definitely a headwind.But nevertheless, I think we have been able to keep the margins above the 50% and looking forward there are three major blocks to drive margin improvement and the first one, the most important one is continue to develop highly integrated complex, high value added type of products to our customers, that made their product better and that made the user experience better. And we do that all the time, and 5G is a great opportunity to demonstrate our technology leadership and help improve as a result of that our margins.Of course in addition to that, we will continue to work out operational cost structure and drive down the cost in our factories and with our suppliers and all of that, and then last but not least, of course yes there is a little bit of a tailwind in terms of mix. Our broad market business has a higher gross margin that our mobile business, and our broad margin business has been growing and will continue to be growing faster than mobile and so we get a little bit of tailwind there as well.Liam Griffin: Yeah and I will add one thing to that comment. I think that if you look at 5G and the complexity of 5G and the types of unique systems and engines that are being deployed, the margins there are going to be higher. I think there's going to be fewer players in the industry that can execute to the level that our customers need to be successful.So I think you've got a case where the 5G inflection and the power of that connection and the value that that's providing is going to translate to better growth margins, it’s just the way that’s going to run. Now working within our factories is going to make it even easier for us, but there's going to be, and there should be for us you know meaningful margin rules with the roll-out of 5G as we get a higher level of concentration there.Operator: And your next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach from Morgan Stanley.

We're looking at antenna arrays that are very rich, high content, complex high margin, going to be pivotal to that, and they use a lot of unique technologies that we also bring to market, including some ceramic technologies and other filtering technologies, as well as our gallium arsenide expertise.

So we are going to continue advancing that category, and we’ll use the filtering technology that’s best equipped for the application. We’ll continue to use TC-SAW and some areas we’ll bulk acoustic wave, and in some areas maybe it will be in diversity receive, maybe it will be in transmit chain.So again, just having the ability to create that unique customization for each and every one of our accounts is important for us.

This was down slightly on a sequential basis, but you have to take into account that we also have Huawei related revenue in that broad market business.If I exclude Huawei, actually it was up sequentially, as well as year-over-year in the mid-single digits. So very pleased with our performance in growth markets, as multiple drivers there, the Wi-Fi 6 adoption, the 5G opportunity beyond the mobile phone, as well as some good traction in our audio play that we have as well.Liam Griffin: Yeah Blayne, let me add a couple of other interesting points here. In addition to kind of the run right opportunities in broad markets, we've really been focused on cost – what I call customer acquisition. Going out there and finding new account that we can populate with our technology and we made some really good progress design wins now with Honeywell, design wins with Ford, design wins with Continental, Rockwell, Siemen, we have some other great account that we can't talk about yet that are on the cusp.So we're really happy with the ability to run broad markets in a diversified way, but also capture significant customers that just haven't been part of the Skyworks family, right, because we haven't been selling to these guys.

Also you know when you mention CapEx, you know one of the things that we do at Skyworks is we craft our technology and build it in house. We very rarely outsource. We do it in house; we have incredible capabilities to customize a wide range of TC-SAW products, TC-SAW base products with that filter inside and also our Bulk Acoustic Wave portfolio.So the CapEx that we have is actually strategic technology investments.

It’s difficult to do it without some of the things that we make here at Skyworks and some of our other peers, so that's one.But at the other side here is, you know the Huawei situation is a Huawei situation. There are trade issues in China, we get it, but if you look outside Huawei and you look at Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi, our business is very strong, very strong and there’s a lot of 5G launches going on right now with Skyworks.There were some initial launches where we had a baseband provider in there and there were some content in there that we didn’t win, but that’s turning over. So we see tremendous momentum and what we call the OVX side the Oppo, Vivo, Xiaomi side within China. So that continues to go on and as Kris noted we’re playing it down with Huawei.

We’d like to get the lion’s share and I think we will, but it’s an increased opportunity and in the complexity that you see in these new phones, the Phase 7 devices specifically are deontic right?It takes the best and the brightest to go out there and execute it, so we’re seeing that, but I will tell you that in addition to the traditional stuff that you see in low band PAD and maybe some of the DRx, we’re starting to move up the mid and high band. We’re starting to move up with mid and high band pads, which could be a really meaningful high potency opportunity for us for content. You mentioned, we talked about the UHP that’s continuing to gain not just with MediaTek, but with some other accounts.So the aperture’s widened a bit, but one of the common themes here is complexity, like you said, the number of devices, the number of hand-offs carrier aggregation, the power consumption and the efficiency required to drive these 5G devices, it’s just going to be a game changer in terms of challenge and that’s exactly what we want to see.

But we’ve also uplifted the technology with Bulk Acoustic Wave. We're already delivering ultra-high band solutions right now that are very compelling and our customers love them.We're moving into mid and high band also with accounts and then you have just an incredible inflection and infrastructure that we talked about, and then further on we’ll start to see the 5G opportunity really penetrate multi markets; automotive, machine-to-machine applications; we talked a little bit about that, enterprise, a lot of really cool stuff that we're talking to customers about and some of that maybe later into late 2020 to ’21, but there's a really significant tail on that.But in the meantime, all the companies that you named and all the OEMs that are on the table, we are deeply engaged and we have been for quite a while and feeling really good about where this is moving.",AID_7,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

We could have gone outside to do that at a lower performing engine, that’s not the way we want to go. So there's a lot of complexity right now.There's a customer engagement with us. We're always reaching into our accounts, but they are coming into us too. So it's a difficult transition to make technically, but it has incredible benefit. And so we saw a lot of great action in the last quarter, a lot of action in design wins, lots of discussions, lots of visits to our sites from our leading customers to go in and really kick the tires on some of the things that we are working on and most customers walking away with confidence.So we think this is going to be a very significant – this is more than a mobile inflection.

I feel it’s a design win activity in the last six months or so that has really accelerated, the sampling activity across a whole set of OEMs, also some really good work with base band partners. We've done some exceptional work with MediaTek for example, transitioning from a strong position in Phase 6 now shifting to Phase 7, which is all 5G; launching the higher frequency bands with BAW.

2502,3081,7070,7070,"Yes, let me share with you some deals and achievements that we have made on C2M so far. And two to three years ago, we have started our C2M model and this is started in the categories of IT products and have achieved amazing success. And all this IT categories, actually our platform over 70% of products are C2M to JD and these has not only impacted our platform, but actually have quite deep influence to the China's IT industries online and offline. And for this year we have also made our strategic proposals, so for the categories, especially on the two categories on home appliances and FMCG products. And compared with other online platforms, I believe there are two advantages to produce C2M products on JD platform. First of all, we are a company driven by technologies. We have a vast data in returns of our users comments and the searching data and viewing data, and combining all these data and working together with our partners will help us to generate the more to tailor-made products in a timely manner. And secondly, per se JD is a retail platform and especially our 1P business. So this gives us an advantage to work closely together with our brands, our partners together on producing those C2M products and in between we have our capacities on the supply chain, these give us a better responsibility and capacity to produce the most - to produce the most effective products together with the partners and the partners will become more and more willing to work with us to reach success. And so, we have to realize that for different categories and industries, the purpose to produce C2M products will be different and some of them are doing C2M products to avoid price conflicts and by doing C2M and more tailor-made products will help them to reduce the complex or conflicts opportunities. And for some other brand partners, they want to go deeper into China's market to the lower-tier cities and we know that based on our traditional supply chain this is not an easy way. And for JD, we would like to be the company on this process with our partners to together reach new users in the lower-tier cities together. That's why, based on our powerful supply chains it will be very unique opportunity for the partner - for our brand partners to work with us to be more attractive, which our customers in the lower-tier cities. And in terms of the above margin, because different brands have different goals and different formats it's very difficult to give you a unified measurement, but generally speaking, the C2M price, it's very competitive, and there is always ways we can also make reasonable interest the benefit and profits out of that. And the overall, you have already seen the success as we made on the IT categories, and it has occupied a strong market share, and we believe this will be copied in other categories as well. And in the future we'll continue our efforts on C2M and increase the proportion of products on our platform. Thank you.Sidney Huang: So just to put in lay man's terms, just to give you an example, on C2M margin, it's a triple win situation. So for example, because a lot of the brands will try to protect their offline retail network, so they will monitor the sales price, which limits our ability to give more value to consumers. So for select - only very large brands can do that. And then at the same time, they would also resist giving us even lower procurement price just to prevent us from starting lower price to consumers. But by C2M we can really breakthrough both. One is that because it's a customized product, so we wouldn't interrupt the brands offline retail channels, so we can price the products lower to give consumers more benefit.

I'll give you one example and sometimes and more often than not, lower price if used effectively can be the best marketing spending. In other words, you can save marketing costs by promotion and so sometimes lower gross margin could mean more marketing expense as well. Clearly, that's what happened in Q3.

We had a solid Q4 in the foundry, logic market. Implicit in the guide for Q1 is a record foundry, logic quarter for this company. We ended the year with backlog at record levels. So, the foundry, logic view we see as follow-through into next year and it's not a one quarter phenomenon. There is a strong pull from customers for the tools. It's multiple customers and multiple nodes, which gives us a sense of comfort. We take a look at the foundry market and one foundry customer are well under the ramp of N7, volume production at N7+, N5 and risk production, volume production in the first half of 2020 and N6 risk production in the first half of '20, volume production in the second half of 2020. You could make other similar comments about leading edge technology nodes ramping at other foundry, logic customers exposed to the leading edge. So multiple customers, multiple nodes.In addition to seeing strength on the leading edge, we continue to see strength on trailing node geometries and specialty nodes, that continues. And while we don't have perfect visibility for the full year, we're very positive on the foundry, logic market over the long run. We are layering in the next wave of compute in the semiconductor industry to complement what is already there in the form of PC demand and mobile compute demand. We've got new architecture sharing data centers, lots of new tape outs, cloud demand is recovering, 5G beginning to kick in. We see a proliferation of intelligent edge devices and auto is growing.And so as we take a step back, we see the strength continuing into next year. We're really positive about the long run. But as I provide a little more context on 2020, the company is performing well. We talked about the backlog entering the year. We talked about strength in foundry, logic. We talked about AGS set up and looks good as we profile into next year. Swing factor next year for us is timing of the memory recovery. For us, it's a matter of when, not if.

We sit down about a third year-over-year and that's where we ended up. Where forecast expectations were set probably three, six months ago, embedded in that was incremental growth off of these levels. And what really drove that incremental growth is as we said solid performance of the TV market into next year and the handset market would recover creating incremental growth for the company. We think the handset market is going to play out exactly as expected. We're going to see recovery in the handset market.What's happened in the interim in the TV side is, is we've seen several news headlines from some of our customers about delayed investments there's a bit of inventory build on the TV side. Third-party research firm has come out and confirmed what we've been reading about in the headlines. And our customer conversations also confirm this dynamic. And so as we look forward into 2020, we think there's going to be some incremental softness on the TV side that reflects all of the news that's out in the market to date. We expect the handset to recover as we originally expected, and that gets us to flattish profile, similar revenue levels to what we're seeing this year. That's the best way I would describe it.And then from an OpEx perspective, I think we're going to take this one quarter at a time, we came up to 800. We all know that profiling into Q2 there's the full impact of merit, and we don't get the benefit of the shutdown over the holiday season.

But beyond that, it's really how do we enable not just materials or removal, how do we create structures, shape structures, modify and analyze structures. And I’ve spent a lot of my time with R&D leaders across our customer base, tremendously strong pull for improvements in power performance and Applied is in the best position, both with unit processes and with these integrated processes to enable the future.

As you know, gross margin in any given quarter, so it’s going to be a function of a few things, revenue level, segment mix, product mix, customer mix, factory activity. All are going to vary from quarter-to-quarter and go into the gross margin. We think our performance compares favorably with our peers ever this cycle. Our peak to trough gross margin over this cycle was down about 210 basis points to our next closest competitors in the process tool space. One was down 300, another was down 310. And as we were profiling into the back part of the calendar year on a relative basis, I think that gross margin performance on the quarter-over-quarter basis also looks pretty good.So, we like how are executing. Are we ever satisfied with our gross margins? No. Are we maniacally focused on driving improvements and improving the cost structure? Absolutely. We are going to keep at it.

We talked about the transactional nature of the business, transactional spares last quarter, being bit of a temporary dynamic with a limited number of customers and this is us just getting back to more normalized environment. Clearly, customers are seeing the strength we're beginning to flash in foundry, logic. I think we're seeing some early signs around the setup for memory as we go forward led by NAND and DRAM. And it's hard to really parse against that contextual backdrop, exactly what's in customers’ minds when they drive transactional part of the business. I would just say, in general, it feels like a good setup with some positive momentum.

2546,3082,23716,23716,"Yes. Thanks, Pierre. So, it’s important to remember that when customers are scaling -- I would say the first thing is that they are driving five different areas where shrinking is one of those five different areas. We talked about new architectures, new structures, new materials, new ways to connect chips together and the shrink. So again, we have tremendously unique technologies enabling that new playbook. And I'm with one of the R&D leaders for one of our customers next week, with another one the following week. Again, constantly, we're getting tremendous pull in driving power and performance because it’s very, very, very difficult. So the first thing I would say is that we have unique capabilities in enabling the new playbook. That's where we're investing, that’s where we have tremendous engagements with customers.So then if you think about shrinking, I talked earlier on the call about where we're working with customers on multiple patterning. And there are cases where we're able to reduce the number of steps by 30% and increase pattern placements. So that's another area we're doing co-optimization. And it's also important to remember that as you're scaling and EUV layers come in, some other steps also need to shrink and multi-patterning is still growing. So with Applied, the EUV steps that are coming in to replace other steps are not our steps. So Applied has opportunities and we are winning. When EUV is being adopted in some of those replacement steps, there's this focus on multi-patterning where we're focused on reducing steps, reducing costs.I think another -- Pierre another really good example is in 2019 in foundry, logic, we have very strong momentum with our sensory etcher. And this is where you're seeing the highest EUV adoption. We're seeing very high growth in 2019 with wins across many customers, and we definitely see significant growth, much faster than the market with our sensory etch business in leading foundry customers. And we anticipate based on the wins that we have, we're going to continue to grow at 5 and 3, as these new technologies are being adopted. Just another data point with Sym3, that's the fastest ramping product in the history of Applied, we just shipped our 4,000th chamber, and many of them going into foundry and logic. So that's kind of a top-level view. I would say, again, the key thing for all of these customers is how do they drive the technology roadmap for power and performance. 2D scaling is slowing down, they need new ways to drive the roadmap, and that's really the sweet spot for Applied Materials.",AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2552,3082,488,489," what we're seeing in memory is customers continuing to drive technology roadmaps this year, even if they're cutting the capacity additions to help with supply and demand. We really like the setup for Applied when memory spending recovers, which we think is in 2020 led by NAND. So, if we look at different types of devices, in DRAM customers are moving to more advanced metal gate transistors in the periphery, and this is going to drive more demand like we saw in 28 nanometer foundry. So, that's really positive for us in leadership areas like Epi, PVD, implant, thermals, also we are gaining share in etch. We're also enabling new DRAM capacitor module capabilities and new patterning technologies that create large new opportunities for Applied where we're reducing the number of steps for multi-patterning and also improving pattern placement.So DRAM, especially with the more logic-like types of steps really plays to our leadership positions. And so, as those nodes go forward, we're in a good position in DRAM.In 3D NAND, as customers are scaling beyond 96 layers, we're winning new applications with etch and NAND. And as you go to more layers, you need new materials, especially high selectivity hard masks designed in to many of the next nodes as they ramp into a high-volume manufacturing. We also have momentum with integrated materials solutions. One example is in NAND where we do co-optimization of new hard mask films with the sensory etch, the co-optimization increases etch selectivity by about 50% and we're seeing new [DAP] [ph] and etch wins across multiple customers as we enable much better high aspect ratio patterning. So, strong pull across all the NAND customers for new materials, new products, Integrated Material Solutions we're seeing both in NAND and in DRAM.

So if we look at foundry, logic, in this calendar year we will have the highest foundry, logic revenue ever, highest Epi revenue ever, and highest metals revenue ever. So, those are areas that are part of our leadership products. We are working with customers on new materials like tungsten deposition, shaping structures with selective removal where we are gaining key wins. That's enabling performance gains for our customers and growth for Applied. So those are some of the areas where we are seeing growth.

2555,3083,8750,8750,"Yes. For the slower revenue growth, there are factors there, which is mainly due to the slower-than-expected travel demand due to the macro headwinds, especially in certain destinations like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Greater China region. For example, during the October holiday, the weakened rhythm of travel momentum, the travel demand year-on-year change during the October holiday was the lowest level for both domestic and outbound in the past 8 years, especially for outbound travel industry, which was decreased by 15% year-on-year. And outbound traffic to Hong Kong declined more than 50% in recent months, which also resulted in a steep decline in the accommodation and air ticket prices.Overall, the outbound travel wallet fleet decreased from 13% to 14% year-on-year in the first half of this year to just a 1% year-on-year in the third quarter. However, as always, we will continuously outpace industry growth. For example, in the accommodation revenue from the overseas, if we are excluding Greater China destinations, our overseas hotels grow about 50% year-on-year. And the Ctrip brand low-end hotel delivered close to 40% quarter growth, and revenue for our domestic high-end hotel maintained a very strong growth momentum. Similar to our accommodation business, our international air tickets business achieved a higher -- in a higher multiple against the industry growth during a slow quarter.

And how does that look going forward in the context of competition?",QID_4,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_support
2574,3084,9445,9445,"we don't - strategically, Pinduoduo has always been a platform designed to address all user base across both geographic and socioeconomic spending. So our focus on brands in recent promotions is a result of us trying to fill up the holes or the gaps in terms of product portfolios on our platform. We have noticed that with increasing demand - as we bring in more users, I would say, from Tier 1, Tier 2 cities, there are demand and interest in product or categories that where our brands are important and these have been historically areas where Pinduoduo hasn't been being very strong at.And as such, we have focused on bringing brands onto the platform. We also are very effective to run promotional campaigns with these brands in terms of creating a recognition of the quality of experiences in terms of letting people understand that real value and authenticity of the products are not in direct contradiction of each other. And that helped us to build trust very quickly with that cohort of users. And this is why, I think, from our perspective, we will continue to explore opportunity to work with more brands.That said, of course, as we have discussed in our prepared remarks, of course exclusively continues to be a factor at play. Whilst we have merchants willing to work with us, we have done that a lot of times, we need to explore alternate ways of bringing it on to our platform products, which could have otherwise been made available to us much more directly. So from our perspective, we're seeing that experience of consumers being impaired through that process and thus additional friction is creating additional costs.Nevertheless, I think our interest remains in making sure that the product our users are interested in are available, and we will do our best to continue to source and work with merchants to bring those products onto our platform.In terms of C2M, as you asked, it is still small, and it's going to take a long time before they become a meaningful GMV contributor. Put differently, I think the way that Pinduoduo as a platform is differentiated is the fact that we are very much thinking from the perspective of the consumers. Our slogan of more saving, more fun, it is a consumer-oriented approach to e-commerce.Not only are we trying to make it easier for all the merchants to do business on our platform, we also want to make sure that our consumers are able to get the best value. C2M is an example where we try to basically create value in the existing supply chain by eliminating improving existing supply chain. In terms of C2M, and in terms of monetization of C2M brands, we are not going to be - well, put differently, because we have the ability to aggregate demand and to provide our manufacturing partner with insights into consumer preferences, we believe Pinduoduo is better equipped than other - our competitors to drive demand for the C2M brands.At the same time, it is important that we allow the C2M brands to have enough exposure opportunities on our platform. This is why we cannot off the bat work with thousands of manufacturers and try to bring them all onto the platform all at once. We're working with these vendors one by one. In the first batch, we had around 20 manufacturing partners across a couple of major categories. And we are now up to around 65 partners in our new brands and C2M program.So we will continue to invest in our C2M initiative. We believe in the longer term, that's what's going to provide sustainable value to and differentiated value to our users.

We really don't think it's a trade off.We always think the money we spend is an investment. We are always looking at long-term investment opportunities where we can spend the money. When there is opportunity, we should spend our money aggressively. We shouldn't put our money into the piggy bank.So with that said, we will be often in a seemingly ironic situation where numbers are very beautiful, it usually means we didn't grab the opportunity good enough and we're - we were being too conservative. While on the other hand, where the numbers are not so shy, probably means we seized the opportunity we're aggressively spending, just like when we put up the slogan RMB10 billion subsidiary, we really mean it.

2585,3084,15659,15659,"first of all, in terms of users acquisition, as Colin mentioned, related to that it - again, our focus on user engagement, right. In order to make sure that the vast majority of our user base have a good and solid experiences. And more importantly, in terms of trying to drive growth, it's more important that will increase.And the one thing we can do is help induce the increased frequency of the activities on our platform, both in terms of making purchases, but also in terms of having great experience and therefore helping to share and helping to draw in new users.So as we have talked about, our sales and marketing expenses really encapsulate a few different parts, offline advertisement aside, really comes from, both in terms of online user acquisition, but more importantly, on promotional activities and coupons. And as we mentioned before, we evaluate the ROI of these promotions and coupons by looking at the behavior change of our users after they receive the coupon.So for example, we would observe our users time spend, whether they share with their friends and invite new users as well as the AOV, order frequency and product categories purchased. If we observe that some users only purchase when they have a coupon and do not do anything else, then these will be low-value users that do not meet our ROI thresholds for investment.On the other hand, if our - we see our users are responding to a program the way we expected to and are sharing that we would choose to continue those programs above and beyond a certain shopping holidays or festivals. As Colin had mentioned at the last earnings call, Pinduoduo is not a platform designed specifically to have peaks around shopping festivals, but instead we want users to be able to come to our platform all the time and be able to find the best value for money and products.And we believe the spending pattern that we're seeing with our Tier 1 users on our platform over - well over RMB5,000 based on Q3 annualized figure is a good testament to the quality of their experiences and the quality of the user base that we're seeing similar to our larger peers.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2586,3084,5445,5445,"In terms of our Company's growth strategy, I would say, actually, it is not so much growth versus monetization, but rather on engagement.So if you look at - and I think it is good to focus on our annual spending per active buyer. As we mentioned at the annual spending per active buyer for the quarter - for the last 12 months ending in September, it's RMB1,567. In that context, we also referenced the Tier 1 buyers for the annualizing their spending in the third quarter is well over RMB5,000.We actually think that RMB1,567 average spending per user is a very healthy number because that number needs to be put in context of the absolute number of buyer ads in the past couple of quarters. In Q3, for example, we added the most number of active buyers in the last seven quarters.And the reason why we think it is important to actually think about user engagement as opposed to growing the absolute size is because of the social or the tiered purchase nature of our platform.As we continue to activate our users on platform to increase their engagement to explore more, and this is why promotional programs like the $1 billion subsidy continue to be so impactful is as users learn more about products and features on our platform, have good experiences and build further trust with our platform, they also tend to share more.So we actually see the growth in our user base more as a derivation or a natural offshoot of users having great experiences on our platform. And we are convinced that by having strong user engagement, good user experiences, monetization will follow.So I would say that in terms of the foreseeable future, first question for next year, we are going to continue to prioritize user engagement, i.e., how to increase users frequency or platform, increase the product - the number of product categories that they purchase and explore on our platform and to increase our wallet share with these users.

2590,3084,779,779,"As we have communicated to the investors in the past, there has been no change in how we think about sales and marketing. Our focus is still very much on first growing our user engagement; and secondly, on our user base.So to the extent we can grow faster, while meeting our ROI hurdle, we will choose to do so. And that means we can reach a wider user base at an even earlier stage and start converting them into loyal PDD users over time.How exactly can we improve the ROI, I think it depends on how we can improve the user engagement and one of the things that you would note that we are doing is to continue to enrich the product categories on our platform and we are leveraging promotional events and coupons to encourage our users to explore new product that we bring on to the platform and to enhance their experiences and to build trust through that process.What do I mean by that is as our user base continue to expand, the type of product that they demand are going to continue to vary. And one of the things that we have noted as an example is that there are certain demand for branded and imported products on our platform from our users. And this is particularly true in categories such as cosmetics and mother and infant care. And it is important that we let our users understand and experience first-hand that the product that they can procure in these categories on platform are genuine, are high-quality and are competitively valued.And this is why we have been quite successful with our RMB10 billion subsidy program, which, as we have communicated, we aren't paying out RMB1 billion ourself, but instead we are leveraging marketing resources, and we're working with merchants to address - providing this program to our investors, and by encouraging them to try these categories, which they may not have otherwise do. That allows them to experience firsthand and develop a trust with our platform much earlier.I would also note that our other cohorts are now already spending a few thousand RMB each year on average. And as Colin mentioned, our Tier 1 users today are already spending well over RMB5,000 based on annualized 2019 Q3 spending.

Because first question, there's ongoing uncertainty with the trade war that's impacting overall demand and customers are putting a pause on CapEx spend. It is weaker than a year ago, but it seems to be stabilizing at this level. For comms and 5G, there is a lull between deployment. As I said in the prepared remarks, comms is inherently lumpy it's very early days on the 5G, and we're expecting demand to kind of stay soft through the end of this calendar year, but pick up nicely for 2020. And as I mentioned in the remarks, we're expecting comms to grow year-over-year in 2020. Specific to ADI, we've got a couple of things that are impacting our first quarter. So as I had mentioned, I think we've had a couple of questions on this now. We are proactively reducing inventory in the channel and then on top of that, the Chinese New Year, which is normally a nonevent if it falls in the middle of a quarter, this time is falling at the end of our fiscal first quarter.",AID_7,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2694,3088,508,508,"So first, let me start by reiterating our model. 70% is our long-term model. And as you saw in the good times, we were operating above that, closer to 72% plus. And in these last 2 quarters -- or last quarter -- or in the current quarter with some of the revenue compression were in the high 80s. So through a cycle, we're still going to see 70%. But the way I kind of guide you to think about it is there are 2 factors, utilization and mix. Mix doesn't change, and given kind of where the outlook is industrial is going to be above 50%. We have lower utilization in the first quarter, and this is going to impact the per quarter margins and bring us down to that sub-70%. The first quarter does not have the reserve headwind, but it does have the lower utilization. So on a go-forward basis, what happens is really going to be macro-dependent. As volume comes back, we will have pretty significant leverage from where we are.

In 2020, we would expect to exit the year with about $50 million of those savings in the run rate, and that will be split between OpEx and cost of goods sold. We'll have those savings sort of feather in over the course of the year. That is, at this point, kind of roughly a net number.

And as you said, the Analog market naturally has deep and wide competitive moats, given the complexity of the technology, the diversity that's required to be a stable, long-term supplier into those markets. And of course, the life cycles as well are very, very long. So I guess, the way to look at it -- the threat from local players in China, well, it really isn't anything new. But no, there's a lot of other facets of -- that require just beyond the product. The quality levels we ship are in the parts per billion. The support required is very, very sophisticated, very complex. And I think the asymmetry between the skill set and talents that we have as an analog supplier compared to anybody else, that asymmetry is pushing more and more towards ADI. So the gap between the skills that we have and many others that gap is growing. So I think to just finish up my commentary here on China.

Automotive, I'll probably call it 5% to 10% maybe sequentially. So both those seasonally are up. We don't have visibility into those orders today.

2704,3088,4696,4696,"Yes. So just remember that we manage the business on a sell-through basis. We're reporting revenue on a sell-in basis. And over the course of 2019, our sell-in was roughly equivalent to sell-through. But as we've seen revenue come down towards the later part of 2019, the levels in the channel have gotten outside of our preferred range of 7 to 8. So we're taking specific action. We began in Q4, we'll continue in Q1 with a goal that by the end of Q2, we will get channel inventory kind of back in that 7- to 8-week range. The result is that we're going to be putting less into the channel than the channel is selling out.

And I think one of the areas that I'm pleased -- most pleased about is in our power portfolio, which cuts across all the various sub application areas in automotive. I'll give you a couple of examples. We've won an integrated power management solution for a market-leading Tier 1 radar platform. We're the key reference design at a market-leading vision camera supplier. And given the strength of our infotainment business as well in DSP and audio signal processing solutions, we've been able to bring more power management from the OTC portfolio into that particular suite of applications as well. We've talked before about our A2B and -- our A2B solution. So today, that only represents kind of low -- very low single digits of our auto portfolio. But the design pipeline is gaining robustness.At this point in time, we've got design wins at around 14 OEMs, and half of them are currently in production. So my sense is that over the next 3 years, we can double the size of our A2B business. And also the other facet of A2B is that the TAM for it is expanding into being able to participate in active noise cancellation and power delivery. Prashanth has touched on the BMS side of things. So that will continue to be, we believe, a strong growth driver for the company, probably up around double digits in 2020. And on the autonomous vehicle side of things, we're sampling a CMOS-based radar solution that doubles the dynamic range against anything else that's out there from our competitors. So I think we have some very, very good innovation drivers in the business as well as the fact that we are bringing the OTC portfolio into many, many new accounts in new geographies.

That's a bit better than mid-teens, maybe down about, say, 10% or so year-over-year, that implies, I would say, worse than seasonal sequential growth. Part of that is demand, part of it also reducing the channel. Automotive, it's right around that mid-teens percent down year-over-year, and comms is down a bunch more in the mid-teens and down sequentially as well.

The outcome of the quarterly profile really is just the timing of these deals.

Aart, following up on the conversation we had when you were here in New York a couple of months ago, regarding the next big thing in EDA, you answered that prototyping, broadly speaking and new requirement and extraction would be the next growth driver for EDA.

Unfortunately at the pick on track a little bit here, but, so if I look at the numbers from the guide you guys are giving us like kind of like 21%, 22% operating margin for Q1, but that implies the kind of the rest of the year that Q2 to Q4 is going to be around 28.6%.

It is rarely the needs to increase specific skills, because our teams are actually quite strong and very broad, but every so often, bringing in some specialists, let's say, for example, in the prototyping or in the intersection of hardware and software can be quite beneficial as well.So, the fact that we are hiring, I think you can take as a positive in general and adding much more, it probably enters the competitive knowledge space, I'll refrain from that.",AID_20,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Given you guys have a good portion of FPGA, HAPS, hardware and also you completed the acquisition of the DINI Group recently, I'm kind of curious from your vantage point and it looks like five years or more than five years out, where do you stand on the durability of FPGAs for AI applications? Reduced down on the FPGA versus SIG debate.",QID_24,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
2741,3089,25390,25390,"Well, the AI field itself is a field that has its own specialty and many, many companies that all making different bets. And it's useful to take a small step backwards, which is fundamentally, AI has one need, which is much, much, much, much, much faster computation. Well, no matter how hard we push on Moore's Law and so on, that's hard to achieve. And so the answer by definition has to be therefore, architectures will become optimized for different applications. Now, architectures can mean chips, it can be groups of chips, it can be FPGAs, it can be a combination of things. And actually a number of the very large suppliers who provide combinations of processors together was graphics processors together was FPGA pieces, all with one objective optimize for an architecture that's appropriate for specific situation.And so, in many ways, we ourselves have been a user of these capabilities, because of course, we use a lot of computation for our software tools. But the hardware tools that we provide is our own way to say for certain tasks, such as for simulation, we can do much better on an emulator or FPGA board. So, I expect all of these technologies to continue to evolve to continue to be available in various combinations and the race will continually be on of how do you build machines that can do really well.My last comment is, we ourselves are the provider of tools to a vast, vast group of emerging AI companies. And this is encouraging, because I think those people will not give up for quite a while in trying new architectures and some will ultimately go into very large volume. And so, in many ways, we see a number of those companies as hard technology drivers for Synopsys. And business wise, we're doing very well with them.",AID_24,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2742,3089,16241,16241,"Okay, Jay. The next big thing and of course, next is always a function of short-term, long-term, medium-term, you name it. But we have to say, I sort of agree with my answer that I gave you a number of months ago, which is that the more systems we complex, the more it's necessary to essentially build mark-ups, we call those prototypes of them to see how well they work, because the working is often illustrated on how well the software runs and the challenges may very well be inside of the hardware. But in other words, you always have a very complex modeling proposition of how do you create a prototype of the hardware, the level of abstraction of the hardware to use that word and then run software on its agency, how fast is it? How much power does it consume, or there weird stops? What happens if something breaks, can you restart it if it's in the middle of some lock-up of things like that. And these things become a dramatically more important if the systems also impact life dangerous situations, such as driving a car or operating as some machinery. And it is very clear that a lot of the world is going is actually in that direction. So, how well have we done with that. Well, initially, we went after some markets that was considered to be extremely slow moving in stodgy and that was the automotive market, and that's quite radically changed a few years ago when two things happened. One is a car [indiscernible] Jeep and it was literally driven off the street by somebody using a cell phone. And secondly people suddenly saw the coming about of autonomous driving with all the potential and the challenges for security and safety.And it's been quite remarkable to see how the OEMs. So these are the end car companies have in term pushed on their Tier 1, which is their supply chain, which in terms pushes on the semiconductor guys which is their supply chain to now start putting all of these capabilities in model, so that they can assemble at long before the car is actually already has a prototype. And so we've been central to that and it's been quite rewarding to see how quickly this has advanced on an industry that fundamentally for good reason has to be slow, because it has to be safe.Now the concept I just described, actually happens in all of the more sophisticated electronic systems and this is only true also for a cellular phone that has a very short time to market where one can run the software on an emulator for example and actually discover surprises before I actually ships the product. So, that is one of the many directions that we are going into and it literally takes advantage of our entire stack of relationships in the supply chain and stack of relationships in the technology levels",AID_18,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2743,3089,941,941,"Yes, you've taken a good point, which is that hardware and IP generally is more variable from quarter to quarter. And the way that we're projecting revenues for this year is no different than how we have done in the past. It's a combination of what is in backlog, as well as our assessment of our ability to close the deals that are in our pipeline and both in IP and hardware.

2744,3089,21282,21282,"Yes, that's correct. I think we said that we hold SIG probably roughly flat and now of course that means if the rest of the ops margin for the Company growth and everybody has to chip in. And we have obviously multiple parts in the Company, everybody is sensitized to the operating margin that we want to achieve for the Company. And so all of the BUs and subgroups are all focusing on how do we get there, while at the same time not making any compromises for future growth. And so, you are probably aware that somewhat loosely, we used the rule of 40 as a guideline and so there is room for people to make improvements to get there. But on a strongly positive note, I think, Synopsys throughout management is not only sensitize to this desire, but very committed and has budget and plans to get there. So, from year to year, I think different BUs will get a little bit more or less of a reprieve as a function of the investment needed or corrections or whatever else we need to do, but in aggregate, we all know that we want to deliver on the numbers that we are guiding you towards",AID_21,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

And if I'm not mistaken, all but one of the businesses are heading towards improving ops margin, one of them is heading a little bit more towards growing the revenue, but in aggregate, and it's sometimes difficult to measure because they intertwine in the deals and so on.

2759,3089,12879,12879,"Well, let me just take a first step back, given that we've had the unique experience of growing Synopsys literally through these phases as well. And I'm always thrilled by the fact that enterprises do go through different phases. And so, the $50 million company is very different than the $100 million and that in term is very different than the $0.25 billion [ph], and $500 million again is different. And the difference is essentially the complexity of how you manage not only internal product development and management, but also the external relationship with the customers. And this is first question also true in the case of the Software Integrity group, because there too, there is also a bifurcation between large enterprise customers that typically are cautious and slow in adopting, but when they adopt they keep adopting and keep adopting and so they become over time the biggest spenders, versus many of the smaller agile companies that very quickly buy a few copies and then it's more ad hoc, how they expand. On top of that, you have the gradual broadening of geography, any of the startups that we acquired originally had certain geographies that they were focused on, we of course, are a global company and therefore open up broader domains.And then the third one, which is maybe more marked here that was in the semiconductor domain we originally was in -- were in is that they deal with individual verticals. And so, dealing with automotive is different than dealing with the financial sector or the health sector and so on. And so, you have sort of these multiple variables and now the question is, how do you deploy and manage your salespeople and support people, I should say against that backdrop of multiple dimensions? And that's just another way of saying, one continually learns and evolves and as we are looking now to Phase 2, which is the crossing of the $0.5 billion and beyond, that is essentially what we are talking about when we are saying, we have the opportunity to optimize our go-to-market again.

We're fortunate to have a set of businesses that are all doing well, some are very profitable also.

2773,3090,6084,6084,"Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. So, first, I would just reiterate that lower markdowns have been a tailwind all year and contributed to gross margin expansion in Q3. I would also call out that our inventory was in great shape at the end of the quarter and heading into Q4 with good balance of core and seasonal products and very low aged stock.  So, with that, with regards to the markdown activity, I think it's important to know that our omni capabilities such as ship from store and our RFID technology allows us to pull the markdown product in stores, in outlets, in DCs on our website for full availability to the guest.  So, this combined with a growing assortment, it does result in a breadth of style on markdown online. But there is just not much depth for units behind. In fact, we have the ability to clear markdowns faster and at better sell-through rates by offering a digitally consolidated pool of inventory.  So, you can't really conclude that we're more promotional by spreading the website when, in reality, we're creating better value for the guest, while clearing what little markdown inventory we have more efficient.",AID_4,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2775,3090,26510,26510,"Great. Thank you. I'll first just mention on the small investment that we made into Mirror and why I'm excited about that and working with Brynn, the CEO of that business, who some of you may or may not know was actually – is a legacy ambassador. She was an ambassador of lululemon a few years ago.  I'm very interested in the space of in-home fitness and that experience. What Mirror provided, which is interesting for us, is the opportunity to learn how the guests are interacting with the content, that is very similar to a lot of how our guests are choosing to sweat, be it through high impact meditation, yoga or other train activities in home. So, it really is an opportunity for us to learn both the balance of how the hardware works and then potentially app and other opportunities down the road. So, it's really a front-row to work with a wonderful person being Brynn that we have a lot of strong relationship with and see.  And I do think, when I look at membership and the opportunity that we have, there is, in this area of content, what we know the guest is responding to is our curation of content in the physical sweat space, and that is really exciting. And experiential and event allow us to curate other physical opportunities for those cohorts to come together.  But, equally interesting is, how we can provide content in a unique way in the digital space. We ran SeaWheeze, 10,000 runners participated, but 6,000 runners globally ran SeaWheeze virtually around the world.  So, there is this beautiful and very exciting balance between physical and virtual that we're interested in and exploring, and membership brings it to life, both in the physical and we are leaning in and learning and seeing white space opportunity around the digital virtual opportunities in which how that content can equally translate into the membership program and beyond. So, it's an interesting opportunity to learn in an area that I am excited about and we are paying attention to.",AID_14,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

Curious how the men's comps were. And then, maybe Calvin this is for you, the comp guide is – I'm sorry to nitpick it – it's a little slower than it was for last quarter.

There was a lot of noise this quarter about intense promotional activity. A lot of people believed that your promotions were higher year-over-year. And yet, you said that you had lower markdowns. So, I was wondering if you could – maybe even to pick your brains in terms of why maybe people are getting the wrong read from their channel checks in terms of your promotional activity? Thanks.",QID_4,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_attack
2778,3090,9518,9518,"Absolutely. Thanks, Erinn, for the question. So, as you know, we've extended the test into the Chicago market which was our most recent in September and that provided us with a unique learning opportunity, in that it's a much larger market for us. Up to that point, we had been in Edmonton, Denver and Austin. In addition, we had our experiential store, so we could understand the connection with that strategy. And I would tell you the results, equal to in the other markets, proved to be very strong. We sold and hit our numbers within the first four weeks and we continue to see very, very positive results across all metrics.  And those are, one, the engagement of our high-value guest. The amount of new guests we're seeing through this program continues to be very strong and we over-index on men relative to our share of sales of men within our business. So, it's proving to be a great loyalty and engagement with our high-value loyal guests, but also an acquisition of new and building our men's guest in a very positive way.  And what we learned in Chicago was just the connection to the experiential store and having the sweat studio in place just strengthens the engagement that the guests have.  Overall, the guest metrics across most levers have been very, very positive on this and we are very encouraged. And as we look towards 2020, we are planning on a broader roll out for next year and we'll share more of that in the coming months, but our intention is to take these learnings and develop the program and expand it into more cities next year.",AID_6,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

So, Calvin, you talked a little bit about the new experiential stores, both in Lincoln Park and the Mall of America. Just wondering if you can expand upon it a little bit. How much of the square footage of lululemon do you think these types of stores can ultimately represent? I think Celeste, on the previous call, talked a little bit about it, but any new color and any learnings that you have on this would be helpful. Thank you.",QID_11,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
2780,3090,16242,16242,"Yeah, there is an element of the role that the educators play. But, in fact, one of the strengths to our brand is we have a long history of our educators being connected in the community, and that's one of the big sources of how we grow and build our ambassador base. So, that's actually not the factor that would cause us to just go at a pace. It really is our decision in control – big part of the membership program and the benefits is we like to host local sweat opportunities in the community with studio partners. And so, there is an element of us wanting to make sure that we source the right that we are able to host these events in these parties, if you like, and then bring our cohorts together. And, therefore, it's just a unique aspect of the program that that we've been doing in the four cities and we want to make sure that, as we scale it, we're doing it in the right effective manner that's going to deliver the right experience for our guests.",AID_10,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame

Just hoping you could just update us on your thoughts on scaling that event strategy. I know it's always been a piece of the community building.

Can you give us some more details on sort of how you planned the events over Thanksgiving weekend because it did look a little more promotional than it did a year ago, but it also seemed like it was very controlled. Can you give us some idea of sort of the thought and how that all came together and how you think about that on annualized basis as well?",QID_8,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_attack
2783,3090,640,640,"Absolutely. Thanks, Ike, for the questions. And I'll the answer the second, sort of teeing up my sort of view of Q3 where I'll sort of touch on our men's business. Our men's business continues to be very strong. In fact, in the quarter, we saw an acceleration of the growth incoming. So, we're very happy with how that continues to grow.  And as I've mentioned before, we're just getting started on our product assortment as well as our activations to drive both awareness and consideration where we see a significant amount of opportunity.  In terms of the guidance we gave for Q4, I'll first start with a quick view of what the growth drivers were in Q3. And as we look at the Power of Three, we're very pleased with the balance across all of those three strategic pillars. Under product innovation, as I mentioned, we saw an acceleration in our men's business and a very strong continuation of growth in our women's. On our omni guest experience, our digital performance continued at a very strong rate and we saw an acceleration of our growth in our stores. And across market expansion, we saw an acceleration of our international business and North America continued its very strong performance. So, very happy with the balance of growth in Q3.  And I'm super excited with the start of Q4. This momentum has extended into the quarter. We had record performance over the Thanksgiving weekend and we're happy the way that the holiday season has begun.  We've always given guidance that we believe is realistic and appropriate, and our guidance for the full-year has always contemplated the comps in this range and our view hasn't changed.  Obviously, what I'd want to draw everyone's attention to is the majority of the quarter is still ahead. There are six fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year, which is a unique calendar shift and is reflected in our Q4 comp guidance.",AID_1,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2784,3090,7247,7248," Thanks for that. That's very helpful. And, Calvin, I was just wondering, for international, now that you're looking for leadership there, what traits or expertise specifically are you looking for? There's been a lot of volatility in terms of international growth for a lot of brands over the years, maybe athletica less so, it'd be interesting to see how you think about what you need there? Thanks.",QID_5,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_support
2785,3090,3180,3180,"Yeah. Hey, Matt. It's PJ. So, yeah, product margin was up 120 basis points. That drove the gross margin increase and that's on continued lower product costs. We had a slight benefit from product mix. Lower markdowns drove roughly 20 basis points of that improvement. I'd say, going forward, the opportunity still remains for us on the product margin side. We'll continue to expand through scale, segmenting the supply chain, better cost visibility, greater efficiency across the distribution network. So, happy with Q3 and where gross margin shook out. We were able to leverage occupancy on higher volume. And at the same time, we continue to make investments in product development, bras, accessories, outerwear. So, the way to think about it, in Q4, we're guiding to again modest gross margin expansion. That will be – we continue to see the tailwind in product costs, but we're also going to continue to invest in product development to keep the top line fueled. So, again, the guidance, modest expansion, tailwinds of product margin. If there's already headwinds, it's the additional investment we're making again to fuel top line.",AID_2,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2786,3090,2759,2760," I guess, maybe first, on the gross margin, so 120 basis points of product margin expansion. This quarter was your best two-year stack in more than a year. So, maybe PJ, how best to think about fourth quarter product margins relative to the third quarter? And then, Calvin, after 800 basis points of improvement over the past four years, how best to rank the remaining drivers of product margin from here?",QID_2,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral
2787,3090,17915,17915,"Great. Thanks, John. Appreciate that. There are really three key elements to the benefit of experiential stores that I'll touch on. And the first is, they really are the pinnacle expression of our vision of the guests living the sweat life. Second is, they create a positive impact across the market. There really is a halo impact. And third would be the brand strength.  So, if I take those each individually. From a living in and creating our vision, we know through the Lincoln Park and early indication on Mall of America is that our high-value guest interacts and frequents these stores on a more frequent basis that they spend more time, that they are both coming back to participate in the sweat activity and/or stay and hang with others at the fuel and that's also translating into shopping as we're seeing very healthy conversion and growing of share of wallet, as well as attracting and building new guests. So, in terms of the general metrics, they're very positive that we just purely look at it through the operational lens and what you'd want from the KPIs.  Equally, and the second being the positive impact within the market, in Chicago, and we're anticipating the same within Minneapolis, is that we do see the overall market lift. And that's a factor of the ambassador community. These are hubs for them where they are spending time and building out both their influence as well as how they influence lululemon and the sweat life community. And, overall, just brand awareness and consideration in both online and physical. So, we're very, very pleased with that. And third is the brand strength. So, if you think of what I believe is truly our unique approach to this loyalty, if you like, it starts with our stores, be it co-located, our current base or in these pinnacle expressions, the experiential. Then you factor in our ambassador community, then you layer in our membership, then you layer in our events, it really is creating a layered halo that's impacting not just loyalty engagement, but our strength within these marketplaces. And these experiential stores are really helping to create a hub to drive that.  And I'll reiterate what I said on Analyst Day which is that experiential stores could represent approximately 10% of our store base in the future. We're excited about the early indication. We're equally excited about how our store base factors into that loyalty equation I just shared with you with the multiple layers of connecting with ambassador membership and events, but experiential will play a key role in tier cities. And we're going to test and learn and see, but they are performing well out of the gate.",AID_11,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2788,3090,25898,25898,"Yes, hi. I'll add my congratulations as well. Calvin, we read about the investment that you guys made in Mirror in the quarter. At the Analyst Day, you spoke to ways to garner greater share of that $3 trillion global wellness pie. Just curious as to how you're evaluating lifestyle or experiential opportunities beyond the core lululemon apparel offering in the next 12 to 18 months? Certainly, we talked a lot about loyalty today and the experiential stores, but just any additional detail about what's getting you most excited from a white space perspective would be helpful there. Thank you.",QID_14,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
2789,3090,23654,23654,"Great. Thanks, Mark. I think the first thing is to recognize that one of the beauties of this brand is that we host a ton of events globally on an annual basis. Now, the size of that event is very different from what a local store may do on a Sunday, bringing in guests to the pinnacle event at SeaWheeze or what we're starting to do with our run events to the Sweatlife festivals that are happening in Europe and events in Asia. So, there has always been, rooted in this brand and the community, is hosting of events.  The opportunity with membership is to build upon that. We know that the guests love the ability to connect with one another, the ability to connect with our educators and our ambassadors within a community, either through sweat or through grow, which is another aspect of the Sweatlife.  And membership just allows us to create even more events. We do see creating more of these Pinnacle events, the 10K event in San Diego. I was down there for the weekend. It was so incredibly powerful. And when you're there and you visit the stores and all three stores in city over the weekend had fantastic results, vibrant, the ambassadors were in the community, 5,000 people running. I was surprised – pleasantly surprised with the number that are running in our gear. So, we are attracting our guests that are really engaged in the essence of what we're creating around the brand, and it's so energetic and electric. Membership will have some unique events. They will have easy and quicker access to other events and some of the local sweat studio classes that we host will be exclusive for them or they can bring a friend too. So, it's not going to be an exclusive. But there will be unique opportunities, but events is an area that we continue to see an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with the guests and drive that loyalty in a very unique way for this brand and in our community that we're really excited and energized about.",AID_13,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

2791,3090,7665,7665,"Thanks, Matt. Great question. And I'm excited about the potential. But I would start with reminding all of us that we have some very tenured strong leaders in place that are running these regions.  Gareth who's been running our European and Middle East markets for the past three years, Ken who has been running APAC has been with us for six years, four-and-a-half in role, and Sen Yen  who's been running our Mainland China market has been with us two years. So, very strong leadership and they will continue to drive these businesses as they have and I have huge respect and confidence in their ability. And this will give us an opportunity to bring in an executive that has added experience in these markets, in particular in APAC where we can just build upon the talent and the strength we have, but build and bring a unique perspective that they've been in the market and can contribute to our continued growth story.  So, for me, we're going to make sure that we select. We're in no rush. We're going to select the right executive talent that has in-market experience and adds to the very strong bench that we have already that have been and will continue to drive the markets for us.",AID_5,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2792,3090,12698,12698,"Yeah, absolutely, Sam. I would tell you – and I was in-market. I had the opportunity to visit a number of our stores across cities, both what was exciting that week, obviously, with us opening up Mall of America, our second experiential store and our fifth location in New York.  There is no change to our execution. We did take opportunity to utilize markdowns that we have as a means to make those available to the guests. But, interestingly, over the weekend, although our markdown performed well, our core growth was greater than our growth in markdown.  So, we continue – even though we had a very strong weekend, as I mentioned earlier, record setting, it was still driven by core, leveraging markdowns as an opportunity to clear through some inventory and really put our innovation front and center which responded well.

We're picking up benefit from channel mix. Regional mix is a little bit of a headwind or to take . The key investments that we are making, we're expanding testing in new growth vehicles such as loyalty. We're going to continue to invest in our North American online guest experience, which has been dragging conversion. We'll put incremental investment behind our Power of Three, particularly our men's business. And we'll continue to invest in our omni platform.

2795,3090,20737,20737,"Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to first ask about just the seasonal stores. As you've continued to invest in those CRM capabilities, curious how the strategy around those seasonal stores have evolved? Earlier, I believe you said 30% of transactions are from guests new to Lulu, which sounds like a big opportunity if you're able to capture and leverage that data?",QID_12,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_neutral
2796,3090,21147,21147,"Absolutely. Thanks for the question, Mark. So, as you mentioned, the pop-up of the seasonal stores serve a variety of really interesting strategies for us. One, they allow us to go in in a very low cost manner to test either new real estate locations within a market and/or a new market altogether.  So, we've been using that for a number of years and it's proven to be very effective where we can either determine the risk or no risk of cannibalization, the opportunity of concentration of multiple stores or to really test the opportunity of a new market. And in that, not only are we seeing current guests being able to shop and interact more with us, but it is proving to be a very, very cost effective way to acquiring a new guest. And then, either we turn that seasonal store into a permanent location and we continue to nurture that relationship or, in some cases, we may not sustain it throughout the year, but continue to come back into the market on an ad hoc basis. But we do maintain the relationships with those guests and then try to transition them into becoming an omni guest where they would shop with us online.  And mainly, we would capture that through our email file growth. And, obviously, in seasonal, our educators know that one of the key metrics when we go in is email capture. So, although we monitor that across our network of stores, in particular in seasonal with it being such an important part of the strategy, that is one of those really important metrics that we work with our educators and our teams to make sure that we're capturing. Once we have it, depending upon the outcome of the location, we would determine to utilize that information and relationship with the guests in a variety of ways. 2018, we operated 63. This year, we have 74. That's sort of the run rate we're seeing. I think about a third transitioned to mainline stores. So, that's sort of our going-in rate. So, I think it's a really exciting strategy, as alluded, our new guest acquisition and validation of markets.",AID_12,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame
2797,3090,15605,15606," And just one quick follow-up. Does that mean like part of this, to really surprise and delight as you put it, your guest? Is this really also then about training, your own people to be able to then go and sort of spread the word as you roll to other cities. So, now you have four cities where you could then bring people in to train them to go out. When you had one, you were limited. Am I thinking about that sort of the right way because you did that with your showrooms and trade people and trade customers? Is that a similar type of manner that you're rolling this out, so your own folks need to be trained  as well?",QID_10,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_specific,Question_3_neutral

It seems that you guys have been adding a few third-party brands. Can you just talk a little bit about kind of the balance you're trying to strike between both of them and just generally kind of what the roll-out strategy from here is with self-care?

2799,3090,11508,11508,"Sure. Erinn, I'll take that question. Thanks. I'd say we're really excited about self-care as a category overall as we test into this. And for next year, we are planning to increase our store distribution. So, currently, it's available in 50 stores and online. As far as third-party, it is only offered on our U.S. e-com site. It is a fairly limited selection. It's approximately eight SKUs.

2800,3090,14027,14027,"Yes. If this notion of line in the sand is a hurdle or number we need to hit before we decide to go or not go, I would tell you there isn't a metric in the markets we've been in that hasn't exceeded our expectations and showing a high engagement with the guest.  We're just being responsibly cautious as we tweak the program and our ability to make sure that we delight the guest. There are a lot of different types of membership loyalty programs out there and majority of them are very easy to operate and execute. And the reason I think the guest is responding so well to ours is it fits with who we are as a brand being experiential.  They are joining a cohort of other guests and joining the community which brings them both event experiences, access to product and access to the Sweatlife which is very unique and different. And they're responding in a very favorable way and we're very excited about it. And we just want to make sure that as we scale it, knowing that we are offering a product for our high-value guest that we're delivering on the commitment and the expectation they have. So, it really is us being cautious in scaling as we do, which is right and prudent on something that I think is so unique special, but we're not rushing. We have no need to rush and the metrics are very positive. So, there is no line in the sand in that regard. And our  next year is to broaden it and we will move forward in, I think, a responsible fashion, but there is no line that would indicate a metric.

2801,3091,3387,3387,"Well, multiple questions there. So, let me try and parse all of that. First, I would say, it's been a really good year for the Experience Cloud in terms of the product innovation, delivering the Experience Cloud, looking at experience manager and moving that to the cloud, innovative new services that we're delivering intelligent services using our AI and machine learning. When I take a step back and look at what's happened during the year, I feel really good about the amount of innovation that's happening. And the second thing I feel really good about is the alignment across Magento, Marketo and just call it, the core DX business in terms of having a more unified and aligned go-to-market, which has not only helped our results, but it's also helped the operating expense associated with that business. And so, we just continue to have a really differentiated offering. The need for people to engage digitally with customers is not just a U.S. phenomenon. It's a global phenomenon. And so that feels really good. And so, I mean, overall, we had a very strong Q4 as we mentioned the Adobe Experience Platform adoption among various verticals. It's such a unique and differentiated product that exists in the marketplace. We're the only company at scale that has the ability to create this unified profile. So overall, I feel really good on that business. We also have tremendous opportunities in 2020. We just continue to scale that business to be delivering it, not just across geographies and the mid-market segment. We talked about how creating an aligned mid-market-focused segment. We saw a rebound as it related to Marketo. Magento continues to do well. And I know, typically, people ask me, what's the update on the hiring front.

As I said earlier, I'm also really pleased with the amount of innovation that the product team has been able to do with all of the new delivery. And the opportunity, as we’ve identified north of $80 billion addressable opportunity in 2022, just continues to be the area of focus for us. And so, we will continue to execute.

2803,3091,21929,21930," I'll touch on one, maybe in a little bit of detail, which is the Adobe Experience Manager. We have, over the last year, really innovated. We have an offering that's a completely cloud-based offering that enables you to do it. You can do headless content management. It's so far ahead of the competition. So, I think that hopefully gives you a glimpse into the fact that we do believe it's an opportunity as we move to the cloud and make these all SaaS-based services, I think making that self-help. In the content management space, in particular, as people are creating these micro sites, and they want to get it up and running quickly, but they want to use the same publishing paradigm that they use for their larger sites. That's another reason, but the new AEM product that we have that's cloud-based. The number of customers who've been able to get up and running really quickly, I think, shows the kind of innovation. Take Adobe itself, for example, as we move our cloud-based AEM implementation, it really adds significant value. And as I said earlier, it's not just about the mid-market, that same technology actually translates well into enterprises seeing value from our products sooner rather than later.",AID_13,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

First Shantanu, maybe now that you've been running the Experience Cloud for almost a year, what are some of the bigger factors in terms of like seeing this business potentially could outperform in 2020 next year. And maybe secondly, just like when thinking about the Experience Cloud business, can you discuss like how demand varies when you think about like the different geographies.

The new services, the mobile funnel continues to do well. As you know, we've feathered that business so that we continue to have a perpetual offering and an OEM licensing offering, those continue to do well. I mean, the reality is that automating inefficient paper-based processes and just the whole collaboration, and sharing and editing of documents is a massive opportunity. And PDF has become the lingua franca for how things happen on the Internet and the PDF brand, I mean, going back to the earlier question. The team has done an incredible job of innovating in that particular space, it's really early.

2810,3091,10664,10665," Yes, Jay, I think both of those continue to be really important strategic objectives for the company as it relates to retention as the book of business gets larger and larger, both in terms of ensuring that they're getting value for the products, as well as from an upsell perspective and being able to upsell them. And you'd be amazed how productive the retention team has been in terms of really understanding what's the right offer, what's the right way to continue to make sure that they get value out of it. The incredible work that's being done even as it relates to payment methods and just making sure that, that is a way to both attract and retain new customers to the platform. So, retention is a very big area of focus, and I continue to believe that it is an area of growth within the enterprise with named user deployment, what we are doing associated with making it really easy for people to adopt our technology. So that, again, is a way in which we are increasing both the ARPU, as well as the number of users in the enterprise. And so, real good focus with some significant results. On the frictionless, I think you clearly see that customers, when they do a search, and if they want to do a search for create PDF, for example, they want that to be immediately fulfilled and get instant gratification. And so, the reason and the thesis behind frictionless is when people are doing something, how can we, within one or two clicks, enable them to do it as well as, at that point, ensure that it's a monetization opportunity for us. And so, I think that'll continue to be both in the document space, as well as in the creative space as we have done with Spark, where you do a Google search and you want to create a flyer, and we want to be able to fulfill that very easily. So, I think it's important and I think expansion opportunity for us on frictionless. So, we're doing well in both cases, and it will continue to be an area of focus. I know you didn't ask it, but you are aware that even on the API side, making sure that all of our stuff is available as APIs is another way to just extend this reach through the partner ecosystem as well.",AID_7,Answer_1_specific,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_no_blame

You guys continue to see a really nice bounce back from the M&A impacts that you saw in – during FY 2019 into Q4.

I just wanted to drill into the comment you made that the revenue growth in the first half of the year would be 17% versus 18% in the back half, but that's a pretty bold statement to make with six months before you're actually in that 18% growth. So, is that purely a function of the expectation that the strength that you're seeing in Digital Experience booking starts to convert to revenue, and you see that part of the business pick up a bit? Or are there other factors at play that we should be thoughtful about as we think of the shape of the year? Thanks.",QID_5,Question_1_Company_specific,Question_2_open,Question_3_attack

And last quarter, there was a discussion about mid-market and perhaps having focused more exclusively on the high-end of the market. Can you just kind of go back and talk a little bit more about how you're seeing that mid-market opportunity for Marketo? How you want to deploy resources and how you think about the mix between mid-market and enterprise for that side of the business?

And I think the combination of what we had with audience manager and the real-time CDP aspects of how we differentiate our solution makes it unique.

And to add to what John said, as you think about the Q4 to Q1 transition, what typically happens in Q4 in the Digital Experience business is, you get a bunch of really good professional services billing as people are preparing our products to get ready for the holiday season, you see a little bit of a rush on the advertising cloud associated with that. There was a little bit of strength also. Acrobat had strength across the board, but there was some additional strength as it related to perpetual and OEM licensing.

We started this fiscal year with expectations for 25% bookings in Digital Experience, and we had a bit of a reset in Q4. Are we at the bottom of the curve and its execution starting to improve? Or execution is back up to the point that you had targeted earlier and that you're just playing a little bit conservative with respect to revenue growth outcome for fiscal 2020?

2823,3091,18369,18369,"Great, Tom. And I think the reason why we believe in the mid-market opportunity across content management across commerce, across what we are doing with the Marketo business and taking leads all the way to making them revenue for a company is that having an easy-to-use self-serve product serves not just the mid-market customer well, but it also serves the enterprise customer well. And I think tongue-in-cheek I have always said, every business starts at a $0 billion business. And so, you want to make sure that you get a huge base of customers who are growing early. And so, that's the reason for the importance of the business. I think over the last few quarters, the demand generation team has done such a good job. A lot of the mid-market demand generation is actually created through marketing activities and then it's actually – it has a very different touch perspective. And so, having that, it's actually a more efficient process for us to do. And by investing a little bit more in demand generation in the last few quarters, we've seen that bounce back well. The product has always been good, the best product in the market. And I think just both inspecting that business and making sure that we invest appropriately and have the right leadership, all of that's really helped with that particular space. Having a depth of offering also, given what we have with experience manager and given what we have with Magento for an end-to-end solution, also really helps in that base.

I mean, when you see what we've done with Acrobat on PDF on the mobile. What we have done with Photoshop Express, tens of millions of users, the fact that we have hundreds of millions of mobile IDs, I think you think about the brand that Adobe has, you think about the depth of technology that we have in those spaces, I'd encourage you to try out a product like Fresco, which whether it's for oil paint, whether it's for water colors, I mean, there's nothing like that on the market with respect to the amount of precision and detail that we provide in that space. And so, we just have to continue to focus on innovating, but given our brand, given the tremendous funnel of traffic that we see to adobe.com, and as we keep pointing out the data-driven operating model that we have to be able to convert it, I feel very good about what we are doing in the mobile arena as well.",AID_9,Answer_1_avoid_excuse,Answer_2_positive,Answer_3_blame
2827,3091,8220,8220,"Yes, Sterling, there are multiple ways in which we monetize our mobile. The first is this multi-system approach that we've taken, maybe using a product like Lightroom, for example. I mean, it's clear when people have images, they want to manage their images across multiple devices. And so, we take a system approach towards that pricing, but it changes quite dramatically, what you could see in terms of the engagement and retention associated with it. So, first in terms of value provided, that's quite significant. The second thing is, we actually have mobile-only offerings as well. And so, you could have a mobile-only offering, whether it's Photoshop Express, whether it's what we do with our Photoshop on iPad. And so, we have one price for – across multiple devices, and where we have one price for mobile-only offering. And the mobile-only offering, I think in the past, we've alluded to the number of ID’s that are being created. And that's also becoming a really nice revenue stream for us and growing. And the third thing I would say is, what we've done a really good job on the Acrobat side is where you have Reader and people have one-time usage, where they're trying to do things with respect to PDF. That's also become a fairly significant monetization model. So, there are multiple monetization models that's attracting new customers, different price points, different segments.

So, a couple of things that come to mind. New customer acquisition just continues to be strong across all geographies. I think the new product introductions that we were doing. Strength in Acrobat across both our offerings was clearly a strength. We saw a very strong seasonal enterprise at the end of the quarter. The stock business just continues to do well. When you have a $539 million quarter, it's hard to point to one thing, Brent. And I think that, again, we've talked a lot about our DDOM.
